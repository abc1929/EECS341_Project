Well it was pretty popular at the time, so we're going to follow our own trend of originality and hold the exact same contest again. The rules for the contest are as follows:\n\n* the question deemed most original *and* discussion inspiring as voted *by the mods* will receive reddit gold and a night with the supermodel of your choice (provided you seek her/him out of your own accord and they agree to your advances)\n\n* 'Sexiest sex you ever sexed' or any other NSFW threads do not qualify. We want originality, not something you can jerk off to. \n\n* threads do not have to be marked as serious to be considered. \n\n* post must be within all the rules of the sub (duh)\n\n* most importantly: this is not forced entry. If you do not wish to wrack your brain thinking of something new, feel free to ask any of the other generic questions that pop up every day. \n\nApart from that, all you have to do is think of a question to post. We will do all the work of saving links and voting on them and whatnot, so you can browse and read the same way you always do. The contest will last for a fortnight from today (this thread will be stickied the whole time), after which we go to our secret hideout on Skull Island and decide which we think is the winner (or winners, if we can't choose). \n\nEDIT: disclaimer that is apparently required - do not post your questions in here.

This is not currently a requirement, but we'd appreciate it if everyone would try their best to do it. If the TIL you are posting is linking to a Wikipedia page, please directly link to the section of the Wikipedia page that is relevant to your TIL submission.\n\nIn most cases this will be 2 - 3 sentences, but up to 4 - 5 should be fine if more context is required. If it's not possible to copy/paste the text, then a screenshot of the relevant part (preferably highlighted) or indicating where in the link provided is the relevant piece of information located is also acceptable. If the source includes audio or video, then please link to the pertinent time stamp and transcribe it.\n\nNote that if a source is *just* a table, graph or other raw data/statistics then you won't be able to quote it (by design) -- find another source (and see below for an explanation).\n \n---\n\nWe'd also like to clarify our first rule about submissions needing to be verifiable with a  reliable source that **completely** supports the claims in the post title. This means that you **cannot interpret data and draw your own conclusions** -- everything must be clearly and *explicitly* stated in your source, in words. \n\nWe encounter a lot of issues when people try to submit technical papers, statistical data or other studies that *may* support a claim, but one that the authors don't explicitly make (and hence subject to extra scrutiny).  You have to make it clear when a source just provides evidence supporting/refuting a hypothesis, but doesn't go as far as explicitly stating it as an accepted fact.\n\nThis means that **merely quoting statistics and implicitly generalizing the results of a study is often not acceptable**. You also need to be diligent about not misleading people with overly simplified, outdated or refuted claims.\n\n---\n\nAs an example, you may come across a paper describing a study where coffee consumption was found to be associated with reduced incidents of cancer.  A misleading and unacceptable conclusion would be^1:\n\n> TIL coffee can cure 58% of cancer patients\n\nOn the other hand, this would possibly be acceptable as the details make it clear that the result is not definitive:\n\n> TIL a 2004 study found that coffee consumption was negatively correlated with incidents of bowel cancer in senior citizens\n\nYou still have to do your research, because if this was later disproven or brought into question then it may  subsequently removed as misleading by omission. A variation that may better address this is:\n\n> TIL a 2004 study found that coffee consumption was negatively correlated with incidents of bowel cancer in senior citizens, *however subsequent research was unable to replicate the results*\n \nOf course at this point your TIL is less of an attention grabber and not particularly noteworthy, but hopefully this highlights some of the issues we face with verifying sensational claims.\n\n^1 unless the authors made the same unconditional claim (which is highly unlikely).\n\n---\n\nWhile we do our best to verify submissions and remain objective, please note that **extraordinary or controversial claims will likely be subject to more scrutiny** and it is up to contributors to make them as airtight as possible (and us to be pedantic). \n\n**TL;DR**: be extremely careful with primary sources, and don't interpret data/statistics yourself --  find a **reliable** source that does that for you and paraphrase.\n\n---\n\n\nAs always, we encourage everyone to report rule violations and send us a message about inaccurate TILs. If you feel something was unfairly removed then please first check the comments and then feel free to ask us (we try our best to tag all removals, but this system is somewhat limited).\n\n", "Provide them in this thread.

Not *too* much actually changed this month, but we had some foundations worked out which will better help us make changes in the future.\n\n---\n\n#Verified Photographer flair!\n\nOur largest change in the month of March, we added a new process and flair for people to become verified on /r/pics - Verification allows photographers and artists to post directly from their site (assuming they follow reddit spam guidelines). With this, we hope to urge photographers to share their work with /r/pics, as well as show our subscribers some of the best! If you are interested in this flair, please read more in the sticky below this one!\n\n#Automod refresh\n\nOur automod config got a bit smarter. Nothing much to say here, but hopefully less false positives and better spam stopping\n\n#New mods - Unlimited power\n\nAfter working with our new moderators, all have been \"promoted\" to a full moderator. Each even got their own banhammer! We didn't need to share this time!\n\n#Continued work on flair\n\nAgain, not too much happened public facing in the month of March, but we did manage to work a bit more on our flair, and there should be more to say about this in the upcoming months.\n\n---\n\nWe expect to have one new rule addition out in the month of April, with more coming soon.\n\n---\n\nNow let's get to the part everyone cares about:\n\n#Stats\n\nIn March 2016 we:\n\n* Made 42680 moderator actions (Up about 3000 from last month)\n\n* Removed a total of 14709 (Up only 300 or so from last month)\n\n* Removed a total of 8276 comments\n\n* Banned a total of 604 people (This includes temporary and permanent bans)\n\n* Manually unbanned 41 people. (This does not include temp bans expiring)\n\n* Ignored 953 of your reports (Compared to the thousands we get, keep reporting!)\n\n* Stickied 25 posts or comments\n\n* Locked 3 posts (and unlocked one)\n\nIn the month of March, reddit administrators made ***ZERO*** actions\n\nIn the month of March, we received a total of 1 post takedown requests.   \n1 was completely unactionable  \n0 were actioned by us  \n0 were forwarded to reddit and no action was taken on our part", "In the past we've discouraged links to unfamiliar image hosts because we tend to crash their servers or bankrupt them with bandwidth fees whenever they hit the front page and get hit with front-page traffic. In a few egregious cases, we've also encountered a bit of excessive self-promotion.\n\nThis had led to shutting-out many professional photographers and artists who would like to submit their work to /r/pics while hosting the images on their own sites, rather than just imgur, 500px, flickr or deviantart.\n\nMost of the hosting issues seem to have been worked out over the last few years: many good hosts now have affordable plans that can take a 5K-karma post without handing you a bill for half your life savings. So for the past few months, we've been unofficially relaxing those restrictions a little to see how it goes, and we'd now like to open this up officially. \n\n[These are our guidelines for professional photographers and artists who would like to host submissions from their own sites](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/wiki/professionals). We're also offering \"Verified Photographer\" and \"Verified Artist\" flair to users who can prove to us (privately via modmail) that it's their site. Verified status means that other redditors on /r/pics can see that your posts are OC (Original Content) unless you specify otherwise in the post title. \"Verified\" flair will be a condition for linking to your own site, from now-on.\n\nAll of reddit's [self-promotion rules](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) still apply, of course, which means this isn't a license to spam /r/pics or pass off other people's content as your own.\n\nOur subscribers come here to see all kinds of pics--the unusual, the hilarious, and the inspiring--but we know they're hungry for quality above all, and we'd love to see you bring it.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Hi Reddit!

Until next time!\n\n---\n\n**Hello there, /r/Science!**\n\nWe* are a group of researchers who just [published a meta-analysis](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002) of expert agreement on humans causing global warming. \n\nThe lead author John Cook has a video backgrounder on the paper [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEb49cZYnsEl), and articles in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/consensus-confirmed-over-90-of-climate-scientists-believe-were-causing-global-warming-57654) and [Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists](http://thebulletin.org/yes-there-really-scientific-consensus-climate-change9332). Coauthor Dana Nuccitelli also did a background post on his blog at the Guardian [here](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/apr/13/its-settled-90100-of-climate-experts-agree-on-human-caused-global-warming). \n\nYou may have heard the statistic \u201c97% of climate experts agree that humans are causing global warming.\u201d You may also have wondered where that number comes from, or even have heard that it was \u201cdebunked\u201d. This metanalysis looks at a wealth of surveys (of scientists as well as the scientific literature) about scientific agreement on human-caused global warming, and [finds that among climate experts, the ~97% level among climate experts is pretty robust](http://i.imgur.com/oCevIhE.jpg). \n\nThe upshot of our paper is that [the level of agreement with the consensus view increases with expertise](http://i.imgur.com/L7xpRny.png). \n\nWhen people claim the number is lower, they usually do so by cherry-picking the responses of groups of non-experts, such as [petroleum geologists](http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2013/02/14/james-taylor-misinterprets-study-by-180-degrees/) or [weathercasters](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/dec/02/meteorologists-global-warming-consensus). \n\nWhy does any of this matter? Well, there is a growing body of scientific literature that shows the public\u2019s perception of scientific agreement is a \u201cgateway belief\u201d for their attitudes on environmental questions (e.g. [Ding et *al.*, 2011](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n9/full/nclimate1295.html, [Aklin and Urpelainen, 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901113002141), [van der Linden *et al.*, 2015](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118489), and more). In other words, if the public thinks scientists are divided on an issue, that causes the public to be less likely to agree that a problem exists and makes them less willing to do anything about it. Making sure the public understands the high level of expert agreement on this topic allows the public dialog to advance to more interesting and pressing questions, like what as a society we decided to do about the issue. \n\nWe're here to answer your questions about this paper and more general, related topics.

I\u2019m one of them.  We\u2019ve had our successes but honestly, things are getting worse.  The latest trend scares me: people in \u201cclosed primary\u201d states (where you have to be a Dem to vote in the Dem primary for example) are finding themselves switched from Dem to something else without their permission and often with very crude at best signature forgeries on the false voter registration documents.  This is new \u2013 it tells us that election manipulation has been going on too long, not enough people care and now we\u2019re seeing \u201cin your face\u201d examples.  I\u2019m going to go into the history of the issue and what we need to do to change things.\n\n**If it takes me a week or a month or whatever I\u2019m going to answer every question in this thread!**\n\nUrgent: one of the people I\u2019ve worked with over the years is John Brakey based in Tucson AZ.  The AUDIT-AZ election oversight group he founded is now in the thick of it as Arizona now has two election challenge lawsuits going, one filed by John and one by the DNC (Democratic National Committee).  John\u2019s suit seeks to overturn the Arizona election and have a do-over while the DNC wants the court, as a cheaper remedy, to throw out all the Arizona delegates to the convention.  John and AUDIT-AZ need funding immediately \u2013 more about their lawsuit and donation info (via PayPal) is at: http://electionnightmares.com/ - I'm pictured in there, look for the big guy with the fanny pack with the peace sign on it.\n\nNow let me fill you in on some history of this problem...some of it stuff I was directly connected to.\n\nI\u2019ve been involved since mid-2003.  I was brought into this movement as a former IT guy (already turned activist by then) by the work of Bev Harris and I still sometimes refer to myself as one of her earliest lieutenants.  Bev was the first one to turn up serious proof of misconduct in vote counting software and systems when in January of 2013 she found an open-access FTP site (online repository of stuff) maintained by Diebold Election Systems and copied all 40,000-ish files off it over three days.  This, in my opinion, really jumpstarted the debate over bad voting systems.  By 2005 I spent a year in the Seattle WA area working with Bev on election investigations and reporting.  Bev and I still talk and collaborate frequently.\n\n**Important:** the single biggest fallout from Bev\u2019s first reporting, still very relevant today, is that at each county running Diebold voting gear there\u2019s ONE computer where all the precinct and mail-in votes are added up \u2013 the \u201ccentral tabulator\u201d.  Bev showed (with basically stolen copies of the Diebold \u201cGEMS\u201d central tabulator software that as long as you deal with the election database with \u201cGEMS\u201d everything appears secure, but once you open the data in an off-the-shelf copy of Microsoft \u201cAccess\u201d (a crappy database app included with MS-Office) all the security basically vanishes: you can edit every aspect of the election with no password required, no audit trail entry left and you can even edit the audit trail.  When I\u2019ve been involved in forensic exams of voting systems after an election I very, very often find evidence that MS-Access is loaded on there.  In a few cases we\u2019ve found proof it was used.  Voting system software has to be approved and \u201ccertified\u201d ahead of time and MS-Access has never been approved, at all, by any state or at the federal level.  When you see that bad boy on allegedly certified voting systems it\u2019s basically a burglary tool for elections.\n\nAt one point Diebold denied this, saying that \u201cno human being\u201d can alter the data in this manner...so Bev knew somebody with an honest-to-God chimpanzee and we taught HIM to do it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4-wQhtRiP8 \u2013 behind the scenes note, this was possible because the dang thing was addicted to Menthos[tm].\n\nMy reddit username originally matched my real name: James \u201cJim\u201d March.  In 2013 I married another political activist hellraiser, Jill Simpson and took her last name.  Jill is somewhat well known as the formerly Republican whistleblower who put a hurt on Karl Rove: http://www.donsiegelman.net/Pages/topics/Players/Heros/heros_simpson.html\n\nJill and I met doing election monitoring in 2012 for the Obama campaign.  This report on the risks of manipulation of overseas and military voter\u2019s intent got a fair bit of coverage and remains of concern, although we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a top avenue of election management misconduct this year:  http://electionprotectionaction.org/uploads/MOVE%20Act%20nov%205th%20article.pdf \u2013 note that pics of myself and Jill are in there, part of my proof...\n\nIn the summer of 2005 I was arrested in San Diego California for trying to observe the counting of the vote as per California law: http://www.lookingglassnews.org/viewstory.php?storyid=1685\n\nI was released a week later with felony election tampering charges dropped: http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=104x4266418 \u2013 if you scroll through the comments you\u2019ll see that I was controversial among some Dems as I was previously best known as a gun rights activist and lobbyist...in 2002 I was thrown out of the California NRA because I was exposing how sheriffs were selling gun carry permits for campaign contributions and the NRA told me to stop complaining about Republican sheriffs doing that.  I refused.  Yes, I\u2019m still a \u201cgun nut\u201d of sorts.  As you can see, some of the folks on Democratic Underground had...issues with all that :).  They had issues with Bev Harris for another reason I\u2019ll get to in a sec.\n\nBack to election stuff :).\n\nIn 2006 I moved to Tucson AZ and immediately started working with John Brakey who had been tracking election problems since 2002 when he was threatened with assault by pollworkers in Pima County when he realized they were shaving votes.  John and I did a LOT of work exposing Pima County\u2019s election problems (2nd biggest county in AZ, where Tucson is) and in Maricopa County (the biggest by far, centered on Phoenix).  To give one good example of how shady Pima\u2019s election process is, check out this videotaped deposition of the head election tech for Pima County during most of the last decade and decide for yourself if he\u2019s hiding anything: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfPGU4LjN94 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzyxQszono0 \u2013 trust me, he doesn\u2019t usually twitch like that :).\n\nIn 2010 John and I did some digging into election misconduct in Maricopa County: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2TKmkSNAkCfOTMzN2YzZTgtNzIyYi00MTcyLTg4YWQtMzY1NzhkMGFjZTQ1/view?ddrp=1&hl=en&pli=1 which became the basis for a lawsuit trying to reform at least some parts of the process.  This report in turn was mentioned in an appellate court decision awarding fees to, among others, John and I by name: http://caselaw.findlaw.com/az-court-of-appeals/1596645.html \n\nThis was one of the few times this insanity paid anything - $8k each if I recall right?  (I\u2019ll have John chime in on this thread if possible...he\u2019s usually not a redditor.)\n\nThe main reason I\u2019m posting is that while I\u2019m no longer in Arizona (I moved to Jill\u2019s place in Alabama in early 2013), John is still fighting and in the recent Arizona primary election a whole lot went wrong that John is now suing over.  One of Arizona\u2019s problems was a pattern also seen in other closed-primary states where people\u2019s voter registration database entries were altered to deny them the right to vote in the Democratic Party primary.  You can see examples from other states here:  http://heavy.com/news/2016/04/election-fraud-voter-registration-changed-suppression-party-affiliation-sanders-clinton-ca-ny-az-md-pa-what-to-do/ \n\nSpecifically in Arizona, Anonymous is claiming the statewide voter registration database is hackable - vulnerable to SQL Injection along these lines: https://xkcd.com/327/ - and that Anon was able to actually test-hack the data: https://anonymousinvestigationsblog.wordpress.com/2016/03/26/anonymous-report-was-arizonas-voter-registration-database-hacked/\n\nWe also know that the number of sites where a voter could in fact vote were radically reduced from previous elections in Maricopa County, from almost 400 four years ago to about 60 now.  John has evidence of misconduct at some of those voting locations (for technical reasons, not really \u201cprecincts\u201d).  We also find it very suspicious that on election day Bernie won the polling place vote by 60% to 40% Hillary but in the mail-in voting the pattern was exactly opposite \u2013 40% Bernie, 60% Hillary.  We know there\u2019s enough security holes for Maricopa County election staff to have manipulated it and they have a long infamous history of deliberately subverting security enough to pull it off.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has announced that they too are filing suit in Arizona.  They\u2019ll be in federal court.  John\u2019s lawsuit is in state court and because he\u2019s challenging the actual outcome of the election (requesting the whole thing be done over!) he is \u201cfast tracked\u201d with his first hearing on the 19th of this month(!).  He needs financial support immediately for that case.\n\nJohn\u2019s lawsuit has a lot more details at: http://electionnightmares.com/ - he is for real and I\u2019d like you to consider hitting the \u201cDonate Now\u201d button.  He has a real attorney who we\u2019ve worked with before in Maricopa County.  Any help appreciated and win or lose, any and all information he gathers in his suit will be shared ASAP with the public and with the lawyers for the DNC as they follow behind in federal court on a slower timescale (because they\u2019re challenging future procedures, not necessarily the actual outcome.  John\u2019s affidavit gives a decent starting point as to his case: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6Fh3F6hufhDN296Vm1PNE1UY3M/view?usp=sharing \n\nOne other thing...I mentioned controversies regarding Bev.  This relates to a problem I\u2019ve seen ever since the debate over voting machines and processes started.  In 2004 (a presidential election year) Bev got flooded with donations from people on the left who hoped she\u2019d be able to \u201csave the election\u201d.  Yeah...didn\u2019t work exactly although blaming Bev was dumb.  Reason being, if you want to save, well, let\u2019s say the 2020 election from fraud, you need to start NO LATER THAN early 2017.  It takes time to figure out where the weaknesses are, predict how the next round of hacks will go down and sue over them.  Those of us in the election integrity community never EVER get funding in advance.  John\u2019s lawsuit in Arizona is very important but what\u2019s really needed is strategic investigation and litigation intended to go to the US Supreme Court.  I can tell you for a fact that when the US gun rights lobby went to the Supreme Court twice in 2008 and 2010, the planning for those cases began in 2000 with funding and resources from major organizations and budgets starting at half a mil.  The US election integrity movement has never, ever been as well funded and the money that does come in happens in \u201cpulses\u201d every four years.\n\nYou can\u2019t protect an entire national election in 2016 when you start in **2016**.  Ain\u2019t gonna happen.\n\nWe need to switch to crowdfunded support and we need to get this idea of well-planned long-term action established.  That said, among the \u201cquick and necessary\u201d suits this year that DO have results that can be built on, John Brakey\u2019s case via the group AUDIT-AZ has the best chance of quick action that will in turn support suits across the rest of the election cycle.  If you can support his work please consider it\n\nThanks and AMA!\n\n(I\u2019ll be answering in two-hour-at-a-time blocks at least twice a day \u2013 my finances forced me to become a long-haul trucker of all things...)\n\nEDIT: I'll be up again at 9am EASTERN tomorrow (Sunday) for at least a couple of hours...then more across the day.", "**My 5 Questions:**\n\n1.
