I run a business in a small town (the kind that only has one homeless person and everybody knows him by name). When I started, standard procedure was to give out unsold prepared food to customers at the end of the night. Anything leftover beyond that was offered to employees to take home.  There was a group of customers who''d made it a habit to come in before closing, loiter around, buy little or nothing, and wait for the free food at the end of the night. Virtually all of them were kids from middle-class homes who just liked free stuff (who doesn''t?) and didn''t have anything better to do. Their parents would drop them off and pick them up. Some of the kids would get sick of waiting and ask for "their" free food early so that they didn''t have to wait until closing. If the kids saw that we were running low on their coveted items, they''d try to dissuade paying customers from buying the last ones. It was very obnoxious, and they''d even get upset if we sold out and didn''t have any leftovers to hand out-- they felt entitled to them.  *Meanwhile,* many of my employees were kids around the same age who were working because they needed the money. Some of them were saving up for college, but many were from financially strained homes and working to help provide for themselves. The contrast between my hard-working crew and their mooching classmates was ridiculous. One of the first changes I made was to stop the automatic free food handouts to customers at the end of the night and give employees first dibs at leftovers. If business is slow and it looks like we''re going to have a ton of something left, we might make it a special and try to sell it at cost, but whatever is left at the end of the night is offered for free to my hardworking crew, and we''ll even pack it in a to-go container if they want to take it home to their families or save it for lunch the next day. If there''s anything left after *that*, it can be offered to the general public.');

In deformation experiments, we combine steady¨Cstate creep and low-frequency, small-strain periodic loading, similar conditions in which tectonics and tidal flexing are occurring simultaneously. The data reveal that the relevant, power-law attenuation in ice (i) is non-linear, depending on strain amplitude, (ii) is independent of grain size, and (iii) exceeds in absorption the prediction of the Maxwell solid model by an order of magnitude. The Maxwell solid model is widely used to model the dynamics of planetary ice shells, so this discrepancy is important.
