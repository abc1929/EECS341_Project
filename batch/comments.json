His ability to pick up complex ideas and even extend them was unrivaled; other professors reported the same. Pressures of work and many other problems resulted in him not turning up to class often, he still would ace the course. In his final term he did not attend a single class in any subject, he simply turned up for the final exam and midterm. He won the undergraduate gold medal for the university.

My family was loving but very insular in that outside friends were discouraged and spending quality time at home was emphasized above all (dad worked extremely long hours and wanted everyone at home when he got off work, especially on weekends).\n\nI went through a phase in high school where I was sick of turning down invitations to hang out and wanted friends. Unfortunately, I found those friends in the wrong crowd, people who partied a lot and were generally wastrels. Family was well educated and did not so much as drink. So, when I found a group of people who really liked me, I overlooked the fact that all they did was party and started sneaking out to hang out with them, which usually involved a lot of partying. \n\nThis extended into college, and I eventually drifted away from my family (dad didn't speak to me for months at a time, even though he was supporting me financially) and became a huge burnout. Thankfully, this has a happy ending. It took bottoming out for me to realize that I had been the one at fault all along, so I picked up the pieces of my life, applied myself in school, and ended up going to med school. ~10 years later and I'm a doctor married to a doctor and have rebuilt all the bridges I burned with my family.\n\nSometimes people are just shitty. No matter how tight knit the support group is, people can be selfish like I was and be tempted by the easy and hedonistic life", "I am from a good upper-middle class family with divorced parents and my older brother fell into this category. He died at 25 in August after nearly a decade of drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nWhen he hit puberty (middle school) he started acting out at school and wearing all black. He would constantly get into fights and practically lived in detention. He went from an honors student to a straight F student over the course of about two years. He started smoking as much weed as he could and experimenting with whatever else he could get his hands on (alcohol, cough syrup, you name it and he tried to get high off it). My parents took every disciplinary action you can take on a young teenager but he only rebelled harder.\n\nBy his later teens he had began to focus his efforts on getting alcohol. He would go to our local grocery store and steal a bottle almost daily for years. At this point my parents knew it was no longer a question of discipline but rather a deeper psychological issue. He spent many stints in rehab and visited every psychiatrist my parents could find. He also had several trips to jail for petty offenses.\n\nOne thing that allowed him to continue was the fact that my parents were split up. My dad was much stricter than my mom and my mom would work long hours for her job. The long hours were so we could go to college and whatnot, but what happened was they allowed my brother to do whatever he wanted at my mom's house. He used this as his safehouse where he could do whatever he wanted, and with this there was never any real incentive to stop doing whatever his drug of choice was at the time.\n\nBy the time he was 16 he refused to go to my dad's house at all and their relationship became strained. Every night there were fights between my mom, dad, and brother. My dad would come over to my mom's to see us and pick me up to go to his house and there would inevitably be a problem because my brother would high/drunk/angry/whatever. Looking back is hard because I have more or less tried to remove this part of my life (ages 13-18) from memory.\n\nAfter high school what few friends he had left went their separate ways and he became very isolated. He would hold jobs for 1-2 years before being fired for alcohol-related issues. Between jobs he would drown himself in various intoxicants and almost always end up with a trip to the ER for some sort of poisoning.\n\nThis cycle continued for about 7 years, until he went into his bedroom at my mothers house and took his final dose on August 11, 2015.\n\nI can write more about how I turned out or answer any questions for people experiencing something similar.\n\n**EDIT: There is a lot of back and forth on how to prevent this or treat addicts. I'll give my take on that here:**\n\nParents need to set firm rules for their kids as long as they are in their household. Not only that, but they need to be 100% willing to enforce them. It is easy to say \"no weed or alcohol in the house\" to your teenager, but what will allow them to get into trouble is when they bring weed and alcohol to the house and find there are no consequences. Yelling at them and fighting is not a consequence. Lock up their phone. Take their car keys. Whatever you do, make sure they feel enough pain to get the message across that such behavior will not be tolerated in your house. **I met a ton of families affected by addiction and they all had the same rules, and they all had a lack of enforcement mechanism.**\n\nIf things get past the teenage angst and experimentation phase then you've probably got a more serious problem. There comes a point where if everything else has failed, you've got to cut them off completely. You've got to kick them out of the house and force them to see what it's like in the real world. If they are given a comfy room with a bed to come home to every night they are simply not going to try to get better. This is the hardest decision and this is what most mothers (like my own) were unable to act on. There is a real risk that an addict will end up homeless or OD'd in a crackhouse if you do kick them out, which is why mothers of addicts fail to take this step. But if you just let them keep going 99% of the time you will find them dead in their room before they turn 30.\n\n**EDIT 2: People are saying my experience is all anecdotal. That's correct. My experience is limited to a certain demographic and is emotionally charged. I am also not a parent or psychiatrist so I don't have all the answers in regards to child bearing. Only my anecdotal experiences to draw from.**", "My brother ended up like this; though he was headed down a good path for a long time, he was studying to be a doctor. I don't really know what happened, but the pressure that was on him was too much, and he kind of lost it for a while, and now he's an alcoholic and lives at home with my Mum and Stepdad. \n\nI think the largest factor was my parents divorce. It was very ugly; my sister and I had already moved away from home to attend university, but my brother was still at home and so was there when their marriage fell apart. My parents, to this day, do not talk at all.  My Mum tried to have my Dad sent to jail during the divorce; like I can't stress enough how bad it was. \n\nI think maybe the success of my older sister and I also added pressure on him to succeed. My sister has a PhD from oxford, and is not working at a research institute in cambridge. I have a masters of architecture from a very good university as well, and my career is going well. \n\nI think, also, because we have such a large safety net below us, that he will never actually hit rock bottom and change. He has more money than he needs, especially now that he is living with my Mum and stepdad, so he can just drink the day away. \n\n\n \n\n\n", "The high cost of rent/living...homelessness and tech companies...", "Crippling debt and 25 years of playoffs", "having The Office take place in it ", "Micheal Jackson trial and Robert Downy Junior got a flat tire here", "Carrying my daughter's coffin from the funeral home to the hearse.

The sample comprised of 2525 adults who participated in a baseline and a follow-up assessment over a 4.5-year period in the Emotional Health and Wellbeing Study (EMHS) in Quebec, Canada. A two-way stratified sampling design was used, on the basis of the presence of depressive symptoms and metabolic dysregulation (obesity, elevated blood sugar, high blood pressure, high levels of triglycerides and decreased high-density lipoprotein). A total of 87 (3.5%) individuals developed diabetes. Participants with both depressive symptoms and metabolic dysregulation had the highest risk of diabetes (adjusted odds ratio=6.61, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.86\u20139.01), compared with those without depressive symptoms and metabolic dysregulation (reference group). The risk of diabetes in individuals with depressive symptoms and without metabolic dysregulation did not differ from the reference group (adjusted odds ratio=1.28, 95% CI: 0.81\u20132.03), whereas the adjusted odds ratio for those with metabolic dysregulation and without depressive symptoms was 4.40 (95% CI: 3.42\u20135.67). The Synergy Index (SI=1.52; 95% CI: 1.07\u20132.17) suggested that the combined effect of depressive symptoms and metabolic dysregulation was greater than the sum of individual effects. An interaction between depression and metabolic dysregulation was also suggested by a structural equation model.

NLRX1, an NLR protein that negatively regulates innate immunity, was previously identified in an unbiased siRNA screen as required for HIV infection. We find that NLRX1 depletion results in impaired nuclear import of HIV-1 DNA in human monocytic cells. Additionally, NLRX1 was observed to reduce type-I interferon (IFN-I) and cytokines in response to HIV-1 reverse-transcribed DNA. NLRX1 sequesters the DNA-sensing adaptor STING from interaction with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which is a requisite for IFN-1 induction in response to DNA. NLRX1-deficient cells generate an amplified STING-dependent host response to cytosolic DNA, c-di-GMP, cGAMP, HIV-1, and DNA viruses. Accordingly, Nlrx1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with DNA viruses exhibit enhanced innate immunity and reduced viral load.

Whether they change in tandem, or contribute independently to the prediction of chronological age, is not known.\n\nMethods: We address these points using data from two Scottish cohorts: the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 (LBC1921) and 1936 (LBC1936). Telomere length and epigenetic clock estimates from DNA methylation were measured in 920 LBC1936 participants (ages 70, 73 and 76 years) and in 414 LBC1921 participants (ages 79, 87 and 90 years).\n\nResults: The epigenetic clock changed over time at roughly the same rate as chronological age in both cohorts. Telomere length decreased at 48\u201367 base pairs per year on average. Weak, non-significant correlations were found between epigenetic clock estimates and telomere length. Telomere length explained 6.6% of the variance in age in LBC1921, the epigenetic clock explained 10.0%, and combined they explained 17.3% (all P < 1 \u00d7 10\u22127). Corresponding figures for the LBC1936 cohort were 14.3%, 11.7% and 19.5% (all P < 1 \u00d7 10\u221212). In a combined cohorts analysis, the respective estimates were 2.8%, 28.5% and 29.5%. Also in a combined cohorts analysis, a one standard deviation increase in baseline epigenetic age was linked to a 22% increased mortality risk (P = 2.6 \u00d7 10\u22124) whereas, in the same model, a one standard deviation increase in baseline telomere length was independently linked to an 11% decreased mortality risk (P = 0.06).\n\nConclusions: These results suggest that telomere length and epigenetic clock estimates are independent predictors of chronological age and mortality risk.", "So...  where can I buy a treatment to alter my dna to bolster these things toward longevity.

With the increasing utilization of biomass as a \"C-neutral\" form of energy in the United States, these forests are susceptible to clear cutting and large losses of soil organic matter (SOM) to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2). The relative stability versus susceptibility of SOM to degradation can be approximated, in part, through the strength of organo-mineral interactions, that is, the strength of binding between SOM and mineral surfaces in the soil. This study investigated differences in SOM organo-mineral binding between northern hardwood forest stands with varying clear-cutting histories in Bartlett Experimental Forest in Bartlett, New Hampshire. Sequential chemical extractions were performed to quantify SOM storage in organo-mineral pools of various binding strength. In this case study, soils from Mature forest stands stored significantly more SOM in strongly mineral-bound and stable C pools than soils from Cut stands did. Differences in the relative distribution of C in organo-mineral pools in Mature and Cut forests may inform our understanding of SOM bioavailability, microbial decomposition, and CO2 production in ecosystems after clear cutting. These findings should contribute to discussions on long-term SOM stability in northeastern U.S. soils.", "But then selectively cutting just the big mature trees, increases the underbrush, and increases the fire risk.  Right?", "What they are not considering is the carbon storage of the wood product taken off the landscape. Those trees are taken, turned into lumber which then becomes tied up in houses and buildings for 50-80 years. After which that wood can be ground up and used as mulch where it can sit as a landscaping product for another 5-10 years. They also fail to realize modern clear cutting planning and execution mimics wildfire habits, the natural disturbance. When a high intensity wildfire comes through these stands, it takes everything and instantly releases it back into the atmosphere via combustion. Clear cutting or wildfire also has the effect of 'reseting' the forest, which is valuable. Younger stands 20-50 years old support more species of plants and animas then an old growth stand. Old growth should always be on the landscape in some level, it's just that old growth has been romanticized and is not all its cracked up to be.

The quake was also felt in the Capital for about 40 seconds.\n\n* **Depth:** USGS has listed this quake at a depth of 19.2km, making this moderately shallow. \n\n* **Type of Earthquake:** Finally the moment tensor is showing this quake to be a thrust quake, a type of quake which includes quite a fair bit of vertical movement. \n\n* **Intensity of Shaking:** So a quake this large and moderately shallow thrust quake really has a combination of factors for some heavy shaking. The USGS has indicated they expect the local coastline to experience Severe (VIII) shaking. The [DYFI] (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20005j32#tellus) reports show that people further away from the coast are already checking in and the reports seem to be fitting the shake map model.\n\n* **Expected Fatalities:** **PAGER COLOR: ORANGE**\n\nExpected Fatalities | Probability (%)\n-------------------|---------------\nNone | 2\nBetween 1-10 | 9\nBetween 10-100 | 27\n**Between 100-1,000** | **35**\nBetween 1k-10k | 21\nBetween 10k-100k | 6\nMore than 100k | 1\n\n\n* **Expected Costs of the Earthquake:** **PAGER COLOR: YELLOW**\n\nExpected Costs (USD) | Probability (%)\n--------------------|---------------\nLess than $1m | 9\nBetween $1m-$10m | 24\nBetween $10m-$100m | 35\nBetween $100m-$1b | 23\nBetween $1b-$10b | 7\nBetween $10b-$100b | 1\n\n\n* **Aftershocks:** Expect a lot of aftershocks over the next 72 hours. These will taper off, but naturally will be larger due to the significant magnitude of this main event. The largest aftershock can be expected around a 6.7-6.5 event. \n\n* **Tsunami:** NO TSUNAMI WARNING. Still risk for Ecuadorian coastal area to see waves.\n\n****\n\n**Updates:**\n\n****\n\n* **7:10am GMT** - Officials have updated the death toll to 77 with 588 injured. Devastation is pretty widespread with many collapsed buildings and infrastructure. 10,000 troops and 3,500 police officers are responding. Aftershocks have continued and will continue for the coming days.

Here's my response to something a while back in the Seattle subreddit:\n\nProperly formatted permalink: [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/4bfeys/hillary_event_tomorrow_at_rainier_beach_high/d192yuy)\n\nNote: this is not a pro-Hillary comment, this is a comment to clear the air about these talks from someone who works in corporate events.  \n\n\nSo, regarding these kinds of speeches: I work in live corporate events. I've been doing in for 13 years. I travel all over the country doing it, do it at very high level, and have seen many very well known celebrities and politicians (as well as lesser known celebrities and politicians) speak. I've seen Hillary speak before.  \n\n\nWhen it's a mid level celebrity, they're typically soliciting the conference to talk, charging in the $10-50k range, and tailor their talks to the company they're presenting to so that it provides some value.  \n\n\nWhen you have a very high level presenter, like a former president or a major CEO, they're actively courted by the company holding the conference, they charge insane amounts of money (or do it for free for an organization they believe in or for publicity.) But what's more, they talk about whatever the hell they feel like. For example, Neil DeGrass Tyson has spoken at the Tableau conference two years in a row, and he just talks about cool science shit for a while. I saw George W Bush speak at a meeting for a prominent financial company once, and the only thing he said about money was \"I don't think you want my financial advice.\"  \n\n\nWhen I saw Hillary speak, she just talked about her time in the Senate, various issues in the world, and what she thought was happening in the U.S. She did not say anything tailored to the company that paid her to be there.  \n\n\nShe was not yet running for president officially (pre-Obama), and he was not on teleprompter. To get the transcripts from those events, people from her campaign would have to contact the company, have them pull up the archival footage (if they kept it, a lot of times they'll only store it for a year or two,) and then get it transcribed. That can take a long time, or the company might not be willing to release the transcripts themselves because they don't want to be associated with the political fallout.  \n\n\nI can guarantee that she has said something in years of giving talks that would be able to be used against her, because if anyone gives enough talks over a number of years you can misrepresent them--that's what happens to every political candidate ever. So if it's even possible to get the transcripts, I can understand why she wouldn't want to release them.\nAnyway, bottom line is this: Goldman Sachs only pays Hillary $250,000 per speech because she wouldn't be willing to take the gig otherwise (and it's pocket change to them,) and they just want a big name speaker for their event. They'll pay $250,000 to anyone who makes their boring financial conference interesting, and I hope companies keep doing it because otherwise my job is going to suck.  \n\n\nThe reason that Bernie Sanders hasn't done these kind of paid speaking gigs is because until he ran for president, he wasn't a big enough name to draw that kind of money. If he doesn't win the election, you better believe he'll be getting phone calls to do talks for big money. Maybe he'll take it, maybe he won't. But he'll be invited.", "I don't think she said anything other than a typical 'stump' speech.  The whole point f paying her for a 'speech' was to legalize the bribe. I doubt she promised to a crowded room further deregulation or access to taxpayer money. Instead, she gives a pep talk about democracy and the economy. Then she collects her bribe.
