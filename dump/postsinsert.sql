You may remember that some time ago we had a [little contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2z2lu1/announcing_a_small_contest_to_promote_originality/) for the most original question. Well it was pretty popular at the time, so we''re going to follow our own trend of originality and hold the exact same contest again. The rules for the contest are as follows:* the question deemed most original *and* discussion inspiring as voted *by the mods* will receive reddit gold and a night with the supermodel of your choice (provided you seek her/him out of your own accord and they agree to your advances)* ''Sexiest sex you ever sexed'' or any other NSFW threads do not qualify. We want originality, not something you can jerk off to. * threads do not have to be marked as serious to be considered. * post must be within all the rules of the sub (duh)* most importantly: this is not forced entry. If you do not wish to wrack your brain thinking of something new, feel free to ask any of the other generic questions that pop up every day. Apart from that, all you have to do is think of a question to post. We will do all the work of saving links and voting on them and whatnot, so you can browse and read the same way you always do. The contest will last for a fortnight from today (this thread will be stickied the whole time), after which we go to our secret hideout on Skull Island and decide which we think is the winner (or winners, if we can''t choose). EDIT: disclaimer that is apparently required - do not post your questions in here. Post them as you normally would. ');

This is not currently a requirement, but we''d appreciate it if everyone would try their best to do it. If the TIL you are posting is linking to a Wikipedia page, please directly link to the section of the Wikipedia page that is relevant to your TIL submission.In most cases this will be 2 - 3 sentences, but up to 4 - 5 should be fine if more context is required. If it''s not possible to copy/paste the text, then a screenshot of the relevant part (preferably highlighted) or indicating where in the link provided is the relevant piece of information located is also acceptable. If the source includes audio or video, then please link to the pertinent time stamp and transcribe it.Note that if a source is *just* a table, graph or other raw data/statistics then you won''t be able to quote it (by design) -- find another source (and see below for an explanation). ---We''d also like to clarify our first rule about submissions needing to be verifiable with a  reliable source that **completely** supports the claims in the post title. This means that you **cannot interpret data and draw your own conclusions** -- everything must be clearly and *explicitly* stated in your source, in words. We encounter a lot of issues when people try to submit technical papers, statistical data or other studies that *may* support a claim, but one that the authors don''t explicitly make (and hence subject to extra scrutiny).  You have to make it clear when a source just provides evidence supporting/refuting a hypothesis, but doesn''t go as far as explicitly stating it as an accepted fact.This means that **merely quoting statistics and implicitly generalizing the results of a study is often not acceptable**. You also need to be diligent about not misleading people with overly simplified, outdated or refuted claims.---As an example, you may come across a paper describing a study where coffee consumption was found to be associated with reduced incidents of cancer.  A misleading and unacceptable conclusion would be^1:> TIL coffee can cure 58% of cancer patientsOn the other hand, this would possibly be acceptable as the details make it clear that the result is not definitive:> TIL a 2004 study found that coffee consumption was negatively correlated with incidents of bowel cancer in senior citizensYou still have to do your research, because if this was later disproven or brought into question then it may  subsequently removed as misleading by omission. A variation that may better address this is:> TIL a 2004 study found that coffee consumption was negatively correlated with incidents of bowel cancer in senior citizens, *however subsequent research was unable to replicate the results* Of course at this point your TIL is less of an attention grabber and not particularly noteworthy, but hopefully this highlights some of the issues we face with verifying sensational claims.^1 unless the authors made the same unconditional claim (which is highly unlikely).---While we do our best to verify submissions and remain objective, please note that **extraordinary or controversial claims will likely be subject to more scrutiny** and it is up to contributors to make them as airtight as possible (and us to be pedantic). **TL;DR**: be extremely careful with primary sources, and don''t interpret data/statistics yourself --  find a **reliable** source that does that for you and paraphrase.---As always, we encourage everyone to report rule violations and send us a message about inaccurate TILs. If you feel something was unfairly removed then please first check the comments and then feel free to ask us (we try our best to tag all removals, but this system is somewhat limited).');

When people claim the number is lower, they usually do so by cherry-picking the responses of groups of non-experts, such as [petroleum geologists](http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2013/02/14/james-taylor-misinterprets-study-by-180-degrees/) or [weathercasters](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/dec/02/meteorologists-global-warming-consensus). Why does any of this matter? Well, there is a growing body of scientific literature that shows the public¡¯s perception of scientific agreement is a ¡°gateway belief¡± for their attitudes on environmental questions (e.g. [Ding et *al.*, 2011](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n9/full/nclimate1295.html, [Aklin and Urpelainen, 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901113002141), [van der Linden *et al.*, 2015](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118489), and more).

AMA!','self.science','science','Travis_Hagey',0,1905,'I am a postdoctoral researcher at Michigan State University investigating the biomechanics, evolution, and ecology of gecko lizards with special attention to their adhesive toes. I''ve always been interested in figuring out how things work and my research blends that interest with biology. I use an evolutionary approach to understand why animals are shaped the way they''re shaped, This kind of work is sometimes called functional morphology or comparative biomechanics. I specifically focus on the toe pads of gecko lizards, an amazing example of natural nano-technology. Gecko toe pads are a really great system to work with because they have some really unusual mechanics and evolutionary patterns. Unlike other adhesives you may be familiar with (glue, tape, velcro, suction cups), gecko toe pads work completely differently. They are made up of tiny hair-like structures that are much smaller then mammalian hair. These structures are small enough to interact with the surface the gecko is walking on using van der Waals forces (an induced dipole - induced dipole weak intermolecular bond). Simply put, the fact that the gecko hairs are very small and have electrons spinning around them and the surface the gecko is walking on also has electrons spinning around its molecules, results in the gecko hairs being weakly attracted towards the surface. The really interesting part is trying to figure out why there is so much variation across species. Gecko toe pads come in different shapes and their hairs also come in different lengths, diameters, and densities. We''re just now beginning to look into how/why this variation evolved and its affect on performance. With this research, we''ll not only gain a better understanding of how life on our planet has evolved and adapted to different environments, but some of the things we learn can be applied to help solve complex human problems (biomimicry), like sticking to things in space or designing Spiderman gloves.

Im one of them.  Weve had our successes but honestly, things are getting worse.  The latest trend scares me: people in closed primary states (where you have to be a Dem to vote in the Dem primary for example) are finding themselves switched from Dem to something else without their permission and often with very crude at best signature forgeries on the false voter registration documents.  This is new  it tells us that election manipulation has been going on too long, not enough people care and now were seeing in your face examples.  Im going to go into the history of the issue and what we need to do to change things.**If it takes me a week or a month or whatever Im going to answer every question in this thread!**Urgent: one of the people Ive worked with over the years is John Brakey based in Tucson AZ.  The AUDIT-AZ election oversight group he founded is now in the thick of it as Arizona now has two election challenge lawsuits going, one filed by John and one by the DNC (Democratic National Committee).  Johns suit seeks to overturn the Arizona election and have a do-over while the DNC wants the court, as a cheaper remedy, to throw out all the Arizona delegates to the convention.  John and AUDIT-AZ need funding immediately  more about their lawsuit and donation info (via PayPal) is at: http://electionnightmares.com/ - I''m pictured in there, look for the big guy with the fanny pack with the peace sign on it.Now let me fill you in on some history of this problem...some of it stuff I was directly connected to.Ive been involved since mid-2003.  I was brought into this movement as a former IT guy (already turned activist by then) by the work of Bev Harris and I still sometimes refer to myself as one of her earliest lieutenants.  Bev was the first one to turn up serious proof of misconduct in vote counting software and systems when in January of 2013 she found an open-access FTP site (online repository of stuff) maintained by Diebold Election Systems and copied all 40,000-ish files off it over three days.  This, in my opinion, really jumpstarted the debate over bad voting systems.  By 2005 I spent a year in the Seattle WA area working with Bev on election investigations and reporting.  Bev and I still talk and collaborate frequently.**Important:** the single biggest fallout from Bevs first reporting, still very relevant today, is that at each county running Diebold voting gear theres ONE computer where all the precinct and mail-in votes are added up  the central tabulator.  Bev showed (with basically stolen copies of the Diebold GEMS central tabulator software that as long as you deal with the election database with GEMS everything appears secure, but once you open the data in an off-the-shelf copy of Microsoft Access (a crappy database app included with MS-Office) all the security basically vanishes: you can edit every aspect of the election with no password required, no audit trail entry left and you can even edit the audit trail.  When Ive been involved in forensic exams of voting systems after an election I very, very often find evidence that MS-Access is loaded on there.  In a few cases weve found proof it was used.  Voting system software has to be approved and certified ahead of time and MS-Access has never been approved, at all, by any state or at the federal level.  When you see that bad boy on allegedly certified voting systems its basically a burglary tool for elections.At one point Diebold denied this, saying that no human being can alter the data in this manner...so Bev knew somebody with an honest-to-God chimpanzee and we taught HIM to do it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4-wQhtRiP8  behind the scenes note, this was possible because the dang thing was addicted to Menthos[tm].My reddit username originally matched my real name: James Jim March.  In 2013 I married another political activist hellraiser, Jill Simpson and took her last name.  Jill is somewhat well known as the formerly Republican whistleblower who put a hurt on Karl Rove: http://www.donsiegelman.net/Pages/topics/Players/Heros/heros_simpson.htmlJill and I met doing election monitoring in 2012 for the Obama campaign.  This report on the risks of manipulation of overseas and military voters intent got a fair bit of coverage and remains of concern, although we dont think its a top avenue of election management misconduct this year:  http://electionprotectionaction.org/uploads/MOVE%20Act%20nov%205th%20article.pdf  note that pics of myself and Jill are in there, part of my proof...In the summer of 2005 I was arrested in San Diego California for trying to observe the counting of the vote as per California law: http://www.lookingglassnews.org/viewstory.php?storyid=1685I was released a week later with felony election tampering charges dropped: http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=104x4266418  if you scroll through the comments youll see that I was controversial among some Dems as I was previously best known as a gun rights activist and lobbyist...in 2002 I was thrown out of the California NRA because I was exposing how sheriffs were selling gun carry permits for campaign contributions and the NRA told me to stop complaining about Republican sheriffs doing that.  I refused.  Yes, Im still a gun nut of sorts.  As you can see, some of the folks on Democratic Underground had...issues with all that :).  They had issues with Bev Harris for another reason Ill get to in a sec.Back to election stuff :).In 2006 I moved to Tucson AZ and immediately started working with John Brakey who had been tracking election problems since 2002 when he was threatened with assault by pollworkers in Pima County when he realized they were shaving votes.  John and I did a LOT of work exposing Pima Countys election problems (2nd biggest county in AZ, where Tucson is) and in Maricopa County (the biggest by far, centered on Phoenix).  To give one good example of how shady Pimas election process is, check out this videotaped deposition of the head election tech for Pima County during most of the last decade and decide for yourself if hes hiding anything: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfPGU4LjN94 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzyxQszono0  trust me, he doesnt usually twitch like that :).In 2010 John and I did some digging into election misconduct in Maricopa County: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2TKmkSNAkCfOTMzN2YzZTgtNzIyYi00MTcyLTg4YWQtMzY1NzhkMGFjZTQ1/view?ddrp=1&hl=en&pli=1 which became the basis for a lawsuit trying to reform at least some parts of the process.  This report in turn was mentioned in an appellate court decision awarding fees to, among others, John and I by name: http://caselaw.findlaw.com/az-court-of-appeals/1596645.html This was one of the few times this insanity paid anything - $8k each if I recall righ');

What is it like to give instruction to Linus Torvalds? Does he listen to you?2.  The book "Wikinomics", written by Don Tapscot and Anthony D. Williams, opens up with the innovative and open source approach taken by Goldcorp a few years back when facing an important challenge in finding a new mine in one of their concessions. Do you think that the open source approach introduced and prominently advocated by the whole idea of Linux an the Linux universe can be applied in some way to the corporate world? That is, do you think that corporate processes, such as the R&amp;D, could be carried out using an open source approach?3. Do you think society is on the verge of facing another major paradigm shift in the way people approach Internet? As paradigm shift I mean the clash between the social network idea of Internet and the anonymity.  More specifically, in the last 10  to 15 years, social networks have become the prominent reason for which billions of users brows the network every day. My question regards the general perception that the Internet user is becoming more and more sick of having to share it''s personal information.4. It has been few years now that some products of the Linux universe have become available for mobile communication (Ex. Ubuntu touch, 2011). Do you think Linux based OS for smartphones will be able to overcome the legal and technical bind between machine and software, thus making it as easy to install as it is for PCs? In short, will smartphones be able to go full open source?  5. Lately there has been an incremental discussion on the development of AI and the ChatBot. Both Facebook and Google have made important acquisitions in startups of this field. Do you think Linux will also be able to play an important role in such field? Furthermore, do you think that if some or all IA start ups would had shared their insights and undertake a more open source approach the field would have already come up with more prominent achievements?6. What is your take on AI? Professor Jeffrey D. Sachs of Columbia, in recent debate at the NY Graduate Center with Nobel Laureate Paul R. Krugman, said that IA would help lower the cost of foreign aid and thereby give a strong hand in the reduction and eventually the end of world poverty. Do you agree on his view and do you think that the .com industry is going towards that direction?7. Last question on the topic AI. Do you think that there is the possibility of a second .com bubble? Looking at the race to IA and the increasing number of start ups and other companies investing in this field I can''t help but thinking of what happened in the late 90s. Do you think people in the field are diving too quickly head over heels in it? Public Contact Information.Twitter account: @jzemlin | Blog: http://www.linuxfoundation.org/blogs/jzemlin');

AMA!','self.IAmA','iama','rvtjess',0,41,'Graduated from the Vet Tech Institute in 2008 2nd in my class. I''ve since worked in both specialty practices as well as privately and corporately owned small animal clinics. I''m currently at a small animal clinic that does occasionally see "pocket pets".In addition to my full time job as a vet tech, I also pet sit full time in clients'' houses. Some of my clients live in multi-million dollar houses and have very famous next door neighbors. I''ve done everything from feeding hamsters to transporting cats 6 hours one-way to their new owners for clients (never again will I do that...).I also volunteer weekly at a local wildlife rehab center ([just transported a sick fox kit to them yesterday](http://imgur.com/ZWuYiMQ), SO cute) and once monthly at a feral cat TNR (trap and release) clinic where we trap, vaccinate, deworm, spay/neuter feral kitties and then release them back into their colonies. I also hold a seat on my state''s Vet Tech Association board.With all of my free time that I manage to have, I''m also planning a wedding and do agility with my 2.5 year old Aussie/BC gal, Nova. My furry crew also includes an 11 year old red merle aussie, [Jamie](http://imgur.com/DyddBCe); a brown DSH tabby [Voltron](http://imgur.com/Rq5twQu); two tabby point siamese mixes, [Jorah](http://imgur.com/NzztfDq) and [Espeon](http://imgur.com/Rq5twQu); two Sugar Gliders, Banjo and Kazooie; and two Florida box turtles, Pixel and Byte.[Jorah has an especially interesting story](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/3tnpj0/hes_home_update_on_the_baby_kitty_fighting_for/), as he was a feral kitty brought into the TNR clinic on the verge of death so I took him home to care for him. Ended up needing 24 hour hospitalization where he went into cardiopulmonary arrest, but they were able to quickly bring him back to life. He is my miracle baby and is doing fantastic now!!AMA!**PROOF:** I don''t have a copy of my current license, as it is on display at the clinic atm, [but here is my pocket license from last year](http://imgur.com/LDPMYhM).And [here is me walking a client''s cat](http://imgur.com/a/62bth), in case you needed extra reassurance that I am, indeed, crazy enough to do all of these things.**EDIT** I''ll be checking in periodically throughout the afternoon, as I''m at a client''s house and their backyard is just to die for.');

We are a team of biologists who propose to sequence the genome of the Big Dipper firefly (Photinus pyralis), the most common firefly species in North America.You may have seen fireflies flash or glow yourself in the US or around the world, but did you know that fireflies also have a unique importance to science?  The gene behind firefly light, known as luciferase, is used everyday in diverse areas of science like cancer research & food safety.  Since fireflies are culturally important, scientifically important, and have declining populations from problems like habitat destruction, light pollution, and overuse of pesticides, our team proposed the sequencing of the firefly genome in order to preserve the valuable scientific knowledge still locked in the genome and provide genetic markers to help conserve fireflies for the next generation.We have these members of team firefly answering your questions today:* Seth Bybee - Assistant professor of Biology at BYU* Sarah Sander - Postdoctoral associate at Cornell* Tim Fallon - PhD student at MITProof below!* Proof #1: https://twitter.com/fireflygenome/status/721379714045227008* Proof #2: https://www.facebook.com/fireflygenome/Did we mention that the firefly genome is currently a top 5 finalist in a public contest for a fully-funded high-quality genome sequencing?
