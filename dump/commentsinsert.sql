It was half tutoring, half daycare for students that needed a place to go between that time when school ended but before their parents got home. While it was mostly populated by middle and high school students, there were a handful of very young children as well, 5-6 years old. One very little girl (she couldn''t have been older than 6, was probably 5) approached me with a box of chess. She didn''t know how to play but said her father played and she wanted to learn how. I''m not a chess expert, but I''ve played a good amount of games, read a few books, and can beat my friends or a "hard" computer. [Edit: To clarify here, I''m talking about the "hard" setting on my phone, it''s about 1500 elo. I''m somewhere above that, but probably not by much.]I met with this little girl for about 30 minutes every day. In 2 days, she understood all the rules and could play competently. At the end of the week, she tied the game in a stalemate. At the end of the second week, I never won again.Turns out she was the daughter of a professor at my college, and he was an internationally ranked chess player. When I ran into him, he couldn''t thank me enough for teaching his daughter chess as his wife had issued a decree that he wasn''t allowed to teach/play/mention chess around their daughter (understandable, didn''t want to pressure her, or discourage her). Chess was in these people''s genes man.');

INSERT INTO Comment VALUES ('4f6a7t','d26c470','ni_higim',0,3845,'Michael was 7 when I met him, and what set him apart was his ability to direct his own learning, his well rounded intelligence, and his genuine love of learning. He was in my third grade class and it was clear right away he was smart. Could do any math we gave him, spell anything, reading on a level higher than we tested for. And I teach in a town that is pretty pretentious about its kids. Very high socioeconomic level, tons of kids go on to Ivy''s. Many parents think their kid is a genius. Michael''s mom  knew he was smart but didn''t seem to get how smart. But he was never the kind to show off or want to impress people. He loved learning and was so excited to share it with everyone. Some noteworthy things he did- -taught himself about the stock market. His mom wouldn''t let him invest money so he invested theoretical amounts and then showed her what it would have earned. - came in with an autobiography of George Bush to read during silent reading. Not a kid version, the official biography. He was able to tell me all about it, and commented that he disagrees with Bush politically, but felt bad for him because he thought he was pushed into politics by wanting to live up to his dad but wasn''t happy in it. - noticed that some languages have similarities, so started mapping out how he thought they were related. This was in second grade. In third grade he showed me his map and I told him about language family trees and he was so excited. He got really into language isolates and wanted to learn Basque.- related to this he made himself flashcards of Greek and Latin roots to help his spelling and vocabulary.- taught himself hexadecimal and binary, and was working on other computer languages. - he was incredibly socially intuitive and empathetic. He would say to me ''I think so and so is upset'' and the kid in question would be fine. Inevitably before the day ended that kid would have a meltdown or ask to talk to me about an issue. I learned fast to trust Michael''s judgement. This also made him a really great friend. He did it with me too. He''d ask if I was OK and id be having a really rough day. It was so strange but sweet to have this tiny kid say things like "let me know what I can do to support you today."- thought of another! Was also very musically gifted, taught himself some instruments and could identify pretty obscure musical pieces by ear He moved at the end of the year and I lost touch. It was so great getting to be his teacher. It''s cheesy but I learned so much about how to teach and support gifted students by working with him.');

He died at 25 in August after nearly a decade of drug and alcohol abuse.When he hit puberty (middle school) he started acting out at school and wearing all black. He would constantly get into fights and practically lived in detention. He went from an honors student to a straight F student over the course of about two years. He started smoking as much weed as he could and experimenting with whatever else he could get his hands on (alcohol, cough syrup, you name it and he tried to get high off it). My parents took every disciplinary action you can take on a young teenager but he only rebelled harder.By his later teens he had began to focus his efforts on getting alcohol. He would go to our local grocery store and steal a bottle almost daily for years. At this point my parents knew it was no longer a question of discipline but rather a deeper psychological issue. He spent many stints in rehab and visited every psychiatrist my parents could find. He also had several trips to jail for petty offenses.One thing that allowed him to continue was the fact that my parents were split up. My dad was much stricter than my mom and my mom would work long hours for her job. The long hours were so we could go to college and whatnot, but what happened was they allowed my brother to do whatever he wanted at my mom''s house. He used this as his safehouse where he could do whatever he wanted, and with this there was never any real incentive to stop doing whatever his drug of choice was at the time.By the time he was 16 he refused to go to my dad''s house at all and their relationship became strained. Every night there were fights between my mom, dad, and brother. My dad would come over to my mom''s to see us and pick me up to go to his house and there would inevitably be a problem because my brother would high/drunk/angry/whatever. Looking back is hard because I have more or less tried to remove this part of my life (ages 13-18) from memory.After high school what few friends he had left went their separate ways and he became very isolated. He would hold jobs for 1-2 years before being fired for alcohol-related issues. Between jobs he would drown himself in various intoxicants and almost always end up with a trip to the ER for some sort of poisoning.This cycle continued for about 7 years, until he went into his bedroom at my mothers house and took his final dose on August 11, 2015.I can write more about how I turned out or answer any questions for people experiencing something similar.');
INSERT INTO Comment VALUES ('4f6bvz','d26c65p','toobaahmed',0,128,'I come from an extremely supportive family, so all of the following is my own fault, which took a long time to recognize. My family was loving but very insular in that outside friends were discouraged and spending quality time at home was emphasized above all (dad worked extremely long hours and wanted everyone at home when he got off work, especially on weekends).I went through a phase in high school where I was sick of turning down invitations to hang out and wanted friends. Unfortunately, I found those friends in the wrong crowd, people who partied a lot and were generally wastrels. Family was well educated and did not so much as drink. So, when I found a group of people who really liked me, I overlooked the fact that all they did was party and started sneaking out to hang out with them, which usually involved a lot of partying. This extended into college, and I eventually drifted away from my family (dad didn''t speak to me for months at a time, even though he was supporting me financially) and became a huge burnout. Thankfully, this has a happy ending. It took bottoming out for me to realize that I had been the one at fault all along, so I picked up the pieces of my life, applied myself in school, and ended up going to med school. ~10 years later and I''m a doctor married to a doctor and have rebuilt all the bridges I burned with my family.Sometimes people are just shitty.

Both men were last spotted being arrested by deputy Steve Calkins for driving without a license. Neither men were taken to the jail. They just disappeared. His story is that he dropped both men off at Circle K convenience stores and drove away.

For instance, he had Terrance''s car towed and told the tow operator that the car was abandoned. But there were witnesses who saw him pull over Terrance and arrest him.

A single cherry yields roughly 0.17 grams of lethal cyanide per gram of seed, so depending on the size of the kernel, ingesting just one or two freshly crushed pits can lead to death.[Source](http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2013/10/21/8-foods-that-could-kill-if-eat-enough-them/)-----------------tl:drNeutralise the enemy with poisonous rhubarb leaves then feed them *cyanide* cherry stones.');

The way the juries are selected in DP trials excludes everyone who would be more likely to be skeptical of the prosecution''s case, leaving a jury that is way more likely to convict. Something like 80% more likely. You''ll see prosecutors going for the death penalty a lot in close cases for this reason.

NLRX1, an NLR protein that negatively regulates innate immunity, was previously identified in an unbiased siRNA screen as required for HIV infection. We find that NLRX1 depletion results in impaired nuclear import of HIV-1 DNA in human monocytic cells. Additionally, NLRX1 was observed to reduce type-I interferon (IFN-I) and cytokines in response to HIV-1 reverse-transcribed DNA. NLRX1 sequesters the DNA-sensing adaptor STING from interaction with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which is a requisite for IFN-1 induction in response to DNA. NLRX1-deficient cells generate an amplified STING-dependent host response to cytosolic DNA, c-di-GMP, cGAMP, HIV-1, and DNA viruses. Accordingly, Nlrx1?/? mice infected with DNA viruses exhibit enhanced innate immunity and reduced viral load. Thus, NLRX1 is a negative regulator of the host innate immune response to HIV-1 and DNA viruses.');

The thyroid supplementation is probably one of the most harmless lifelong treatment you could get, its kinda of a pain in the butt to balance at the beginning but once its done you''re better off taking the harmless pills (which are very cheap in countries with a decent healthcare system) than to live with a constant check up and fear of a possible surgerySource : just finished a 3 month internship in nuclear medecine');

The abstract follows. _____Background: Telomere length and DNA methylation have been proposed as biological clock measures that track chronological age. Whether they change in tandem, or contribute independently to the prediction of chronological age, is not known.Methods: We address these points using data from two Scottish cohorts: the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 (LBC1921) and 1936 (LBC1936). Telomere length and epigenetic clock estimates from DNA methylation were measured in 920 LBC1936 participants (ages 70, 73 and 76 years) and in 414 LBC1921 participants (ages 79, 87 and 90 years).Results: The epigenetic clock changed over time at roughly the same rate as chronological age in both cohorts. Telomere length decreased at 48¨C67 base pairs per year on average. Weak, non-significant correlations were found between epigenetic clock estimates and telomere length. Telomere length explained 6.6% of the variance in age in LBC1921, the epigenetic clock explained 10.0%, and combined they explained 17.3% (all P < 1 ¡Á 10?7). Corresponding figures for the LBC1936 cohort were 14.3%, 11.7% and 19.5% (all P < 1 ¡Á 10?12). In a combined cohorts analysis, the respective estimates were 2.8%, 28.5% and 29.5%. Also in a combined cohorts analysis, a one standard deviation increase in baseline epigenetic age was linked to a 22% increased mortality risk (P = 2.6 ¡Á 10?4) whereas, in the same model, a one standard deviation increase in baseline ');

With the increasing utilization of biomass as a "C-neutral" form of energy in the United States, these forests are susceptible to clear cutting and large losses of soil organic matter (SOM) to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2). The relative stability versus susceptibility of SOM to degradation can be approximated, in part, through the strength of organo-mineral interactions, that is, the strength of binding between SOM and mineral surfaces in the soil. This study investigated differences in SOM organo-mineral binding between northern hardwood forest stands with varying clear-cutting histories in Bartlett Experimental Forest in Bartlett, New Hampshire. Sequential chemical extractions were performed to quantify SOM storage in organo-mineral pools of various binding strength. In this case study, soils from Mature forest stands stored significantly more SOM in strongly mineral-bound and stable C pools than soils from Cut stands did. Differences in the relative distribution of C in organo-mineral pools in Mature and Cut forests may inform our understanding of SOM bioavailability, microbial decomposition, and CO2 production in ecosystems after clear cutting. These findings should contribute to discussions on long-term SOM stability in northeastern U.S. soils.');

They also fail to realize modern clear cutting planning and execution mimics wildfire habits, the natural disturbance. When a high intensity wildfire comes through these stands, it takes everything and instantly releases it back into the atmosphere via combustion. Clear cutting or wildfire also has the effect of ''reseting'' the forest, which is valuable. Younger stands 20-50 years old support more species of plants and animas then an old growth stand. Old growth should always be on the landscape in some level, it''s just that old growth has been romanticized and is not all its cracked up to be.

Although the antennal genetic circadian clock and the azimuth of the sun are instrumental for proper function of the compass, it is unclear how these signals are represented on a neuronal level and how they are integrated to produce flight control. To address these questions, we constructed a receptive field model of the compound eye that encodes the solar azimuth. We then derived a neural circuit model that integrates azimuthal and circadian signals to correct flight direction. The model demonstrates an integration mechanism, which produces robust trajectories reaching the southwest regardless of the time of day and includes a configuration for remigration. Comparison of model simulations with flight trajectories of butterflies in a flight simulator shows analogous behaviors and affirms the prediction that midday is the optimal time for migratory flight.');

INSERT INTO Comment VALUES ('4f6lci','d26jn6i','marzipandancer',0,7,'Okay, I don''t work for Goldman Sachs, but I see these types of talks all the time. Here''s my response to something a while back in the Seattle subreddit:Properly formatted permalink: [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/Comment/4bfeys/hillary_event_tomorrow_at_rainier_beach_high/d192yuy)Note: this is not a pro-Hillary comment, this is a comment to clear the air about these talks from someone who works in corporate events.  So, regarding these kinds of speeches: I work in live corporate events. I''ve been doing in for 13 years. I travel all over the country doing it, do it at very high level, and have seen many very well known celebrities and politicians (as well as lesser known celebrities and politicians) speak. I''ve seen Hillary speak before.  When it''s a mid level celebrity, they''re typically soliciting the conference to talk, charging in the $10-50k range, and tailor their talks to the company they''re presenting to so that it provides some value.  When you have a very high level presenter, like a former president or a major CEO, they''re actively courted by the company holding the conference, they charge insane amounts of money (or do it for free for an organization they believe in or for publicity.) But what''s more, they talk about whatever the hell they feel like. For example, Neil DeGrass Tyson has spoken at the Tableau conference two years in a row, and he just talks about cool science shit for a while. I saw George W Bush speak at a meeting for a prominent financial company once, and the only thing he said about money was "I don''t think you want my financial advice."  When I saw Hillary speak, she just talked about her time in the Senate, various issues in the world, and what she thought was happening in the U.S. She did not say anything tailored to the company that paid her to be there.  She was not yet running for president officially (pre-Obama), and he was not on teleprompter. To get the transcripts from those events, people from her campaign would have to contact the company, have them pull up the archival footage (if they kept it, a lot of times they''ll only store it for a year or two,) and then get it transcribed. That can take a long time, or the company might not be willing to release the transcripts themselves because they don''t want to be associated with the political fallout.  I can guarantee that she has said something in years of giving talks that would be able to be used against her, because if anyone gives enough talks over a number of years you can misrepresent them--that''s what happens to every political candidate ever. So if it''s even possible to get the transcripts, I can understand why she wouldn''t want to release them.Anyway, bottom line is this: Goldman Sachs only pays Hillary $250,000 per speech because she wouldn''t be willing to take the gig otherwise (and it''s pocket change to them,) and they just want a big name speaker for their event. They''ll pay $250,000 to anyone who makes their boring financial conference interesting, and I hope companies keep doing it because otherwise my job is going to suck.  The reason that Bernie Sanders hasn''t done these kind of paid speaking gigs is because until he ran for president, he wasn''t a big enough name to draw that kind of money. If he doesn''t win the election, you better believe he''ll be getting phone calls to do talks for big money. Maybe he''ll take it, maybe he won''t. But he''ll be invited.');

Their plan was instead to buy 100+ drink cups that weekend and find the piece themselves. Needless to say that didn''t happen and neither of us got anything except they wasted half a paycheck.

This is not quite as bad as the time I had all but one piece of the Pepsi pop culture contest caps.  I had "shop til you ___" and my buddy at school got "drop". This was during the mid 90s and prize was a paid trip to mall of america and $10k shopping spree. I promised to buy him a computer with it if he gave me the piece and he did....

To make matters worse, there arent enough unique videos or pictures coming out to at least give a glimpse into this ancient modernized city. My trip was roughly 3 weeks long. In between seeing family and friends I tried to squeeze in time to take as many photos as I possibly could to hopefully create something that most of you have never seen.
