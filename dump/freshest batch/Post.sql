You may remember that some time ago we had a [little contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2z2lu1/announcing_a_small_contest_to_promote_originality/) for the most original question. Well it was pretty popular at the time, so we''re going to follow our own trend of originality and hold the exact same contest again. The rules for the contest are as follows:* the question deemed most original *and* discussion inspiring as voted *by the mods* will receive reddit gold and a night with the supermodel of your choice (provided you seek her/him out of your own accord and they agree to your advances)* ''Sexiest sex you ever sexed'' or any other NSFW threads do not qualify. We want originality, not something you can jerk off to. * threads do not have to be marked as serious to be considered. * post must be within all the rules of the sub (duh)* most importantly: this is not forced entry. If you do not wish to wrack your brain thinking of something new, feel free to ask any of the other generic questions that pop up every day. Apart from that, all you have to do is think of a question to post. We will do all the work of saving links and voting on them and whatnot, so you can browse and read the same way you always do. The contest will last for a fortnight from today (this thread will be stickied the whole time), after which we go to our secret hideout on Skull Island and decide which we think is the winner (or winners, if we can''t choose). EDIT: disclaimer that is apparently required - do not post your questions in here. Post them as you normally would. ');

This is not currently a requirement, but we''d appreciate it if everyone would try their best to do it. If the TIL you are posting is linking to a Wikipedia page, please directly link to the section of the Wikipedia page that is relevant to your TIL submission.In most cases this will be 2 - 3 sentences, but up to 4 - 5 should be fine if more context is required. If it''s not possible to copy/paste the text, then a screenshot of the relevant part (preferably highlighted) or indicating where in the link provided is the relevant piece of information located is also acceptable. If the source includes audio or video, then please link to the pertinent time stamp and transcribe it.Note that if a source is *just* a table, graph or other raw data/statistics then you won''t be able to quote it (by design) -- find another source (and see below for an explanation). ---We''d also like to clarify our first rule about submissions needing to be verifiable with a  reliable source that **completely** supports the claims in the post title. This means that you **cannot interpret data and draw your own conclusions** -- everything must be clearly and *explicitly* stated in your source, in words. We encounter a lot of issues when people try to submit technical papers, statistical data or other studies that *may* support a claim, but one that the authors don''t explicitly make (and hence subject to extra scrutiny).  You have to make it clear when a source just provides evidence supporting/refuting a hypothesis, but doesn''t go as far as explicitly stating it as an accepted fact.This means that **merely quoting statistics and implicitly generalizing the results of a study is often not acceptable**. You also need to be diligent about not misleading people with overly simplified, outdated or refuted claims.---As an example, you may come across a paper describing a study where coffee consumption was found to be associated with reduced incidents of cancer.  A misleading and unacceptable conclusion would be^1:> TIL coffee can cure 58% of cancer patientsOn the other hand, this would possibly be acceptable as the details make it clear that the result is not definitive:> TIL a 2004 study found that coffee consumption was negatively correlated with incidents of bowel cancer in senior citizensYou still have to do your research, because if this was later disproven or brought into question then it may  subsequently removed as misleading by omission. A variation that may better address this is:> TIL a 2004 study found that coffee consumption was negatively correlated with incidents of bowel cancer in senior citizens, *however subsequent research was unable to replicate the results* Of course at this point your TIL is less of an attention grabber and not particularly noteworthy, but hopefully this highlights some of the issues we face with verifying sensational claims.^1 unless the authors made the same unconditional claim (which is highly unlikely).---While we do our best to verify submissions and remain objective, please note that **extraordinary or controversial claims will likely be subject to more scrutiny** and it is up to contributors to make them as airtight as possible (and us to be pedantic). **TL;DR**: be extremely careful with primary sources, and don''t interpret data/statistics yourself --  find a **reliable** source that does that for you and paraphrase.---As always, we encourage everyone to report rule violations and send us a message about inaccurate TILs. If you feel something was unfairly removed then please first check the comments and then feel free to ask us (we try our best to tag all removals, but this system is somewhat limited).');

Ask Us Anything!','self.science','science','ClimateConsensus',3,4727,'**EDIT**:   Thanks so much for an awesome AMA. If we didn''t get to your question, please feel free to PM me (Peter Jacobs) at /u/past_is_future and I will try to get back to you in a timely fashion. Until next time!---**Hello there, /r/Science!**We* are a group of researchers who just [published a meta-analysis](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002) of expert agreement on humans causing global warming. The lead author John Cook has a video backgrounder on the paper [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEb49cZYnsEl), and articles in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/consensus-confirmed-over-90-of-climate-scientists-believe-were-causing-global-warming-57654) and [Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists](http://thebulletin.org/yes-there-really-scientific-consensus-climate-change9332). Coauthor Dana Nuccitelli also did a background post on his blog at the Guardian [here](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/apr/13/its-settled-90100-of-climate-experts-agree-on-human-caused-global-warming). You may have heard the statistic 97% of climate experts agree that humans are causing global warming. You may also have wondered where that number comes from, or even have heard that it was debunked. This metanalysis looks at a wealth of surveys (of scientists as well as the scientific literature) about scientific agreement on human-caused global warming, and [finds that among climate experts, the ~97% level among climate experts is pretty robust](http://i.imgur.com/oCevIhE.jpg). The upshot of our paper is that [the level of agreement with the consensus view increases with expertise](http://i.imgur.com/L7xpRny.png). When people claim the number is lower, they usually do so by cherry-picking the responses of groups of non-experts, such as [petroleum geologists](http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2013/02/14/james-taylor-misinterprets-study-by-180-degrees/) or [weathercasters](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/dec/02/meteorologists-global-warming-consensus). Why does any of this matter? Well, there is a growing body of scientific literature that shows the public¡¯s perception of scientific agreement is a ¡°gateway belief¡± for their attitudes on environmental questions (e.g. [Ding et *al.*, 2011](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n9/full/nclimate1295.html, [Aklin and Urpelainen, 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901113002141), [van der Linden *et al.*, 2015](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118489), and more). In other words, if the public thinks scientists are divided on an issue, that causes the public to be less likely to agree that a problem exists and makes them less willing to do anything about it. Making sure the public understands ');

Im one of them.  Weve had our successes but honestly, things are getting worse.  The latest trend scares me: people in closed primary states (where you have to be a Dem to vote in the Dem primary for example) are finding themselves switched from Dem to something else without their permission and often with very crude at best signature forgeries on the false voter registration documents.  This is new  it tells us that election manipulation has been going on too long, not enough people care and now were seeing in your face examples.  Im going to go into the history of the issue and what we need to do to change things.**If it takes me a week or a month or whatever Im going to answer every question in this thread!**Urgent: one of the people Ive worked with over the years is John Brakey based in Tucson AZ.  The AUDIT-AZ election oversight group he founded is now in the thick of it as Arizona now has two election challenge lawsuits going, one filed by John and one by the DNC (Democratic National Committee).  Johns suit seeks to overturn the Arizona election and have a do-over while the DNC wants the court, as a cheaper remedy, to throw out all the Arizona delegates to the convention.  John and AUDIT-AZ need funding immediately  more about their lawsuit and donation info (via PayPal) is at: http://electionnightmares.com/ - I''m pictured in there, look for the big guy with the fanny pack with the peace sign on it.Now let me fill you in on some history of this problem...some of it stuff I was directly connected to.Ive been involved since mid-2003.  I was brought into this movement as a former IT guy (already turned activist by then) by the work of Bev Harris and I still sometimes refer to myself as one of her earliest lieutenants.  Bev was the first one to turn up serious proof of misconduct in vote counting software and systems when in January of 2013 she found an open-access FTP site (online repository of stuff) maintained by Diebold Election Systems and copied all 40,000-ish files off it over three days.  This, in my opinion, really jumpstarted the debate over bad voting systems.  By 2005 I spent a year in the Seattle WA area working with Bev on election investigations and reporting.  Bev and I still talk and collaborate frequently.**Important:** the single biggest fallout from Bevs first reporting, still very relevant today, is that at each county running Diebold voting gear theres ONE computer where all the precinct and mail-in votes are added up  the central tabulator.  Bev showed (with basically stolen copies of the Diebold GEMS central tabulator software that as long as you deal with the election database with GEMS everything appears secure, but once you open the data in an off-the-shelf copy of Microsoft Access (a crappy database app included with MS-Office) all the security basically vanishes: you can edit every aspect of the election with no password required, no audit trail entry left and you can even edit the audit trail.  When Ive been involved in forensic exams of voting systems after an election I very, very often find evidence that MS-Access is loaded on there.  In a few cases weve found proof it was used.  Voting system software has to be approved and certified ahead of time and MS-Access has never been approved, at all, by any state or at the federal level.  When you see that bad boy on allegedly certified voting systems its basically a burglary tool for elections.At one point Diebold denied this, saying that no human being can alter the data in this manner...so Bev knew somebody with an honest-to-God chimpanzee and we taught HIM to do it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4-wQhtRiP8  behind the scenes note, this was possible because the dang thing was addicted to Menthos[tm].My reddit username originally matched my real name: James Jim March.  In 2013 I married another political activist hellraiser, Jill Simpson and took her last name.  Jill is somewhat well known as the formerly Republican whistleblower who put a hurt on Karl Rove: http://www.donsiegelman.net/Pages/topics/Players/Heros/heros_simpson.htmlJill and I met doing election monitoring in 2012 for the Obama campaign.  This report on the risks of manipulation of overseas and military voters intent got a fair bit of coverage and remains of concern, although we dont think its a top avenue of election management misconduct this year:  http://electionprotectionaction.org/uploads/MOVE%20Act%20nov%205th%20article.pdf  note that pics of myself and Jill are in there, part of my proof...In the summer of 2005 I was arrested in San Diego California for trying to observe the counting of the vote as per California law: http://www.lookingglassnews.org/viewstory.php?storyid=1685I was released a week later with felony election tampering charges dropped: http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=104x4266418  if you scroll through the comments youll see that I was controversial among some Dems as I was previously best known as a gun rights activist and lobbyist...in 2002 I was thrown out of the California NRA because I was exposing how sheriffs were selling gun carry permits for campaign contributions and the NRA told me to stop complaining about Republican sheriffs doing that.  I refused.  Yes, Im still a gun nut of sorts.  As you can see, some of the folks on Democratic Underground had...issues with all that :).  They had issues with Bev Harris for another reason Ill get to in a sec.Back to election stuff :).In 2006 I moved to Tucson AZ and immediately started working with John Brakey who had been tracking election problems since 2002 when he was threatened with assault by pollworkers in Pima County when he realized they were shaving votes.  John and I did a LOT of work exposing Pima Countys election problems (2nd biggest county in AZ, where Tucson is) and in Maricopa County (the biggest by far, centered on Phoenix).  To give one good example of how shady Pimas election process is, check out this videotaped deposition of the head election tech for Pima County during most of the last decade and decide for yourself if hes hiding anything: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfPGU4LjN94 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzyxQszono0  trust me, he doesnt usually twitch like that :).In 2010 John and I did some digging into election misconduct in Maricopa County: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2TKmkSNAkCfOTMzN2YzZTgtNzIyYi00MTcyLTg4YWQtMzY1NzhkMGFjZTQ1/view?ddrp=1&hl=en&pli=1 which became the basis for a lawsuit trying to reform at least some parts of the process.  This report in turn was mentioned in an appellate court decision awarding fees to, among others, John and I by name: http://caselaw.findlaw.com/az-court-of-appeals/1596645.html This was one of the few times this insanity paid anything - $8k each if I recall righ');

Not to mention, the pay was shit compared to the amount of work I had to do.Though to be fair, O2 isn''t the only one doing this.
