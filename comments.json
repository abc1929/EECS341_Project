His home life is horrible and his behavior presents a serious challenge, but he can skim my notes before a lesson and completely understand it. To keep him engaged, I will sometimes ask him to help me explain a concept, and he can do it just as well if not sometimes better than I can. He has gotten 100% on every test and quiz we've had this year. I asked the principal why this student is in the class that he's in, and he said that administrators won't put him in advanced classes because his behavior is distracting to others.", "Michael was 7 when I met him, and what set him apart was his ability to direct his own learning, his well rounded intelligence, and his genuine love of learning. He was in my third grade class and it was clear right away he was smart. Could do any math we gave him, spell anything, reading on a level higher than we tested for. And I teach in a town that is pretty pretentious about its kids. Very high socioeconomic level, tons of kids go on to Ivy's. Many parents think their kid is a genius. Michael's mom  knew he was smart but didn't seem to get how smart. But he was never the kind to show off or want to impress people. He loved learning and was so excited to share it with everyone. \n\nSome noteworthy things he did- \n\n-taught himself about the stock market. His mom wouldn't let him invest money so he invested theoretical amounts and then showed her what it would have earned. \n\n- came in with an autobiography of George Bush to read during silent reading. Not a kid version, the official biography. He was able to tell me all about it, and commented that he disagrees with Bush politically, but felt bad for him because he thought he was pushed into politics by wanting to live up to his dad but wasn't happy in it. \n\n- noticed that some languages have similarities, so started mapping out how he thought they were related. This was in second grade. In third grade he showed me his map and I told him about language family trees and he was so excited. He got really into language isolates and wanted to learn Basque.\n\n- related to this he made himself flashcards of Greek and Latin roots to help his spelling and vocabulary.\n\n- taught himself hexadecimal and binary, and was working on other computer languages. \n\n- he was incredibly socially intuitive and empathetic. He would say to me 'I think so and so is upset' and the kid in question would be fine. Inevitably before the day ended that kid would have a meltdown or ask to talk to me about an issue. I learned fast to trust Michael's judgement. This also made him a really great friend. He did it with me too. He'd ask if I was OK and id be having a really rough day. It was so strange but sweet to have this tiny kid say things like \"let me know what I can do to support you today.\"\n\n- thought of another! Was also very musically gifted, taught himself some instruments and could identify pretty obscure musical pieces by ear \n\nHe moved at the end of the year and I lost touch. It was so great getting to be his teacher. It's cheesy but I learned so much about how to teach and support gifted students by working with him.", "High school history teacher here. The genius student i had didn't open the textbook once, took very little notes, never came to review sessions, yet sat attentively and answered every question i asked aloud correctly. Showed up to all my tests with just a pencil and would be first to finish nearly every time. Only question he ever got wrong was a bonus one in my first month of teaching that asked the students to correctly spell my last name, as the majority never called me anything but Miss!  \n\n\nFantastic all around kid too: athlete, in the musicals, social, loved by all. Got into every college he applied for. ", "Helped teach a student at another high school who is an extremely talented art student. This kid has the ability to take something from concept to in front of you reality in less than a  few hours. He helped design and build an entire set for a play we did on a ridiculously small budget. \n\nWhat made him so smart is his ability to think through all of the logical steps of the process immediately. He figured out the potential problems before they happened, and took steps to avoid them from the planning stages. \n\nTo me, this is what makes someone an actual genius. The ability to understand and work through a problem quickly and effortlessly that most others struggle with. ", "4th grade teacher.\n\n1.

He died at 25 in August after nearly a decade of drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nWhen he hit puberty (middle school) he started acting out at school and wearing all black. He would constantly get into fights and practically lived in detention. He went from an honors student to a straight F student over the course of about two years. He started smoking as much weed as he could and experimenting with whatever else he could get his hands on (alcohol, cough syrup, you name it and he tried to get high off it). My parents took every disciplinary action you can take on a young teenager but he only rebelled harder.\n\nBy his later teens he had began to focus his efforts on getting alcohol. He would go to our local grocery store and steal a bottle almost daily for years. At this point my parents knew it was no longer a question of discipline but rather a deeper psychological issue. He spent many stints in rehab and visited every psychiatrist my parents could find. He also had several trips to jail for petty offenses.\n\nOne thing that allowed him to continue was the fact that my parents were split up. My dad was much stricter than my mom and my mom would work long hours for her job. The long hours were so we could go to college and whatnot, but what happened was they allowed my brother to do whatever he wanted at my mom's house. He used this as his safehouse where he could do whatever he wanted, and with this there was never any real incentive to stop doing whatever his drug of choice was at the time.\n\nBy the time he was 16 he refused to go to my dad's house at all and their relationship became strained. Every night there were fights between my mom, dad, and brother. My dad would come over to my mom's to see us and pick me up to go to his house and there would inevitably be a problem because my brother would high/drunk/angry/whatever. Looking back is hard because I have more or less tried to remove this part of my life (ages 13-18) from memory.\n\nAfter high school what few friends he had left went their separate ways and he became very isolated. He would hold jobs for 1-2 years before being fired for alcohol-related issues. Between jobs he would drown himself in various intoxicants and almost always end up with a trip to the ER for some sort of poisoning.\n\nThis cycle continued for about 7 years, until he went into his bedroom at my mothers house and took his final dose on August 11, 2015.\n\nI can write more about how I turned out or answer any questions for people experiencing something similar.", "I come from an extremely supportive family, so all of the following is my own fault, which took a long time to recognize. My family was loving but very insular in that outside friends were discouraged and spending quality time at home was emphasized above all (dad worked extremely long hours and wanted everyone at home when he got off work, especially on weekends).\n\nI went through a phase in high school where I was sick of turning down invitations to hang out and wanted friends. Unfortunately, I found those friends in the wrong crowd, people who partied a lot and were generally wastrels. Family was well educated and did not so much as drink. So, when I found a group of people who really liked me, I overlooked the fact that all they did was party and started sneaking out to hang out with them, which usually involved a lot of partying. \n\nThis extended into college, and I eventually drifted away from my family (dad didn't speak to me for months at a time, even though he was supporting me financially) and became a huge burnout.

Both men were last spotted being arrested by deputy Steve Calkins for driving without a license. Neither men were taken to the jail. They just disappeared. His story is that he dropped both men off at Circle K convenience stores and drove away. There isn't as much evidence to go on with Santos' disappearance, but his story was actively disputed by the available evidence when it comes to Terrance's disappearance. For instance, he had Terrance's car towed and told the tow operator that the car was abandoned. But there were witnesses who saw him pull over Terrance and arrest him. What did he do with these men???\n\nMy own theory is that he gave them a Starlight ride: in other words, he drove them into the wilderness and dropped them off for them to walk home and they died of exposure/dehydration. To me it makes the most sense with the evidence.

I've had it once every few months or so for the past six years.\n\nIn the dream, I'm walking with my eyes closed. I open my eyes and I see the back of a white-robed person in front of me. The image zooms out and you see an impossibly long, spiraling line of white-robed people, with the implication that every last person in the world is in the line. \n\nI try to stop walking and I can't. There's a sense of being completely out of control of my body, or rather that someone else is controlling it.

His name is the Scrabbling Man. \n\nThe Scrabbling Man is standing on a small cliff overlooking a very, very blue lake rimmed by red trees. It's a beautiful scene, surrounded by white robed millions. As each person in the line reaches him, he reaches out with his awful hands and turns them around. Then, with a baptism-like motion, he drops them off the cliff and lets them drown in the water below.\n\nI watch him do this to the person in front of me, who is sometimes one of my parents or a friend, and I'm desperate and afraid but I walk forward toward him. There is no choice. \n\nHe reaches for me and I stop him. I say, \"Don't. I can do it myself.\" There's a subtle feeling of false bravado, of pretending to have control and knowing it's a farce, but not being able to simply let the Scrabbling Man do it. Because I know I'm going to die, and I know how I'm going to die, so the only choice I have is who does it, and I'd rather I kill myself than let him get the satisfaction. He just laughs mockingly and steps back. I turn my back to the lake, look up at the sky, and then fall backwards.\n\nIt's so, so beautiful, that blue sky.

In light of current epidemiological trends of disease incidence and rates of vaccine-associated adverse events, the 10-year revaccination schedule has come into question.\n\n>**Methods.** We performed cross-sectional analysis of serum antibody titers in 546 adult subjects stratified by age or sex. All serological results were converted to international units after calibration with international serum standards.\n\n>**Results.** Approximately 97% of the population was seropositive to tetanus and diphtheria as defined by a protective serum antibody titer of \u22650.01 IU/mL. Mean antibody titers were 3.6 and 0.35 IU/mL against tetanus and diphtheria, respectively. Antibody responses to tetanus declined with an estimated half-life of 14 years (95% confidence interval, 11\u201317 years), whereas antibody responses to diphtheria were more long-lived and declined with an estimated half-life of 27 years (18\u201351 years). Mathematical models combining antibody magnitude and duration predict that 95% of the population will remain protected against tetanus and diphtheria for \u226530 years without requiring further booster vaccination.\n\n>**Conclusions.** These studies demonstrate that durable levels of protective antitoxin immunity exist in the majority of vaccinated individuals.

Whether they change in tandem, or contribute independently to the prediction of chronological age, is not known.\n\nMethods: We address these points using data from two Scottish cohorts: the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 (LBC1921) and 1936 (LBC1936). Telomere length and epigenetic clock estimates from DNA methylation were measured in 920 LBC1936 participants (ages 70, 73 and 76 years) and in 414 LBC1921 participants (ages 79, 87 and 90 years).\n\nResults: The epigenetic clock changed over time at roughly the same rate as chronological age in both cohorts. Telomere length decreased at 48\u201367 base pairs per year on average. Weak, non-significant correlations were found between epigenetic clock estimates and telomere length. Telomere length explained 6.6% of the variance in age in LBC1921, the epigenetic clock explained 10.0%, and combined they explained 17.3% (all P < 1 \u00d7 10\u22127). Corresponding figures for the LBC1936 cohort were 14.3%, 11.7% and 19.5% (all P < 1 \u00d7 10\u221212). In a combined cohorts analysis, the respective estimates were 2.8%, 28.5% and 29.5%. Also in a combined cohorts analysis, a one standard deviation increase in baseline epigenetic age was linked to a 22% increased mortality risk (P = 2.6 \u00d7 10\u22124) whereas, in the same model, a one standard deviation increase in baseline telomere length was independently linked to an 11% decreased mortality risk (P = 0.06).\n\nConclusions: These results suggest that telomere length and epigenetic clock estimates are independent predictors of chronological age and mortality risk.", "So...  where can I buy a treatment to alter my dna to bolster these things toward longevity.

With the increasing utilization of biomass as a \"C-neutral\" form of energy in the United States, these forests are susceptible to clear cutting and large losses of soil organic matter (SOM) to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2). The relative stability versus susceptibility of SOM to degradation can be approximated, in part, through the strength of organo-mineral interactions, that is, the strength of binding between SOM and mineral surfaces in the soil. This study investigated differences in SOM organo-mineral binding between northern hardwood forest stands with varying clear-cutting histories in Bartlett Experimental Forest in Bartlett, New Hampshire. Sequential chemical extractions were performed to quantify SOM storage in organo-mineral pools of various binding strength. In this case study, soils from Mature forest stands stored significantly more SOM in strongly mineral-bound and stable C pools than soils from Cut stands did. Differences in the relative distribution of C in organo-mineral pools in Mature and Cut forests may inform our understanding of SOM bioavailability, microbial decomposition, and CO2 production in ecosystems after clear cutting. These findings should contribute to discussions on long-term SOM stability in northeastern U.S. soils.", "But then selectively cutting just the big mature trees, increases the underbrush, and increases the fire risk.  Right?", "What they are not considering is the carbon storage of the wood product taken off the landscape. Those trees are taken, turned into lumber which then becomes tied up in houses and buildings for 50-80 years. After which that wood can be ground up and used as mulch where it can sit as a landscaping product for another 5-10 years. They also fail to realize modern clear cutting planning and execution mimics wildfire habits, the natural disturbance. When a high intensity wildfire comes through these stands, it takes everything and instantly releases it back into the atmosphere via combustion. Clear cutting or wildfire also has the effect of 'reseting' the forest, which is valuable. Younger stands 20-50 years old support more species of plants and animas then an old growth stand. Old growth should always be on the landscape in some level, it's just that old growth has been romanticized and is not all its cracked up to be.

They are also asuming a 100% acccuracy rate for the DSM diagnosis, when in reality, that itself is the target of much skepticism primarily because of its focus on broad symptomology, not on any objective measurable traits. They should, have used a K-means of classes algorythm to asses different subgroups within the ASD data set, and then compared each group individually, and some subsets of groups against the ASD population dataset as a whole, in order to get a higher degree of predictive power, and to asses which specific neuromorphologies are associated with an ASD diagnosis and which may lead to more ambiguity. \n\nAlso, if they would have put the symptomology on a multidimensional scale, and then weighed that dataset against the result of the classes algorythm.

News often misses important or interesting points and to really understand what the researchers were getting at it's important to understand the journal article.\n\n**Abstract:**\n\n>Migrating eastern North American monarch butterflies use a time-compensated sun compass to adjust their flight to the southwest direction. Although the antennal genetic circadian clock and the azimuth of the sun are instrumental for proper function of the compass, it is unclear how these signals are represented on a neuronal level and how they are integrated to produce flight control. To address these questions, we constructed a receptive field model of the compound eye that encodes the solar azimuth. We then derived a neural circuit model that integrates azimuthal and circadian signals to correct flight direction. The model demonstrates an integration mechanism, which produces robust trajectories reaching the southwest regardless of the time of day and includes a configuration for remigration. Comparison of model simulations with flight trajectories of butterflies in a flight simulator shows analogous behaviors and affirms the prediction that midday is the optimal time for migratory flight.", "Cool.

The quake was also felt in the Capital for about 40 seconds.\n\n* **Depth:** USGS has listed this quake at a depth of 19.2km, making this moderately shallow. \n\n* **Type of Earthquake:** Finally the moment tensor is showing this quake to be a thrust quake, a type of quake which includes quite a fair bit of vertical movement. \n\n* **Intensity of Shaking:** So a quake this large and moderately shallow thrust quake really has a combination of factors for some heavy shaking. The USGS has indicated they expect the local coastline to experience Severe (VIII) shaking. The [DYFI] (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20005j32#tellus) reports show that people further away from the coast are already checking in and the reports seem to be fitting the shake map model.\n\n* **Expected Fatalities:** **PAGER COLOR: ORANGE**\n\nExpected Fatalities | Probability (%)\n-------------------|---------------\nNone | 2\nBetween 1-10 | 9\nBetween 10-100 | 27\n**Between 100-1,000** | **35**\nBetween 1k-10k | 21\nBetween 10k-100k | 6\nMore than 100k | 1\n\n\n* **Expected Costs of the Earthquake:** **PAGER COLOR: YELLOW**\n\nExpected Costs (USD) | Probability (%)\n--------------------|---------------\nLess than $1m | 9\nBetween $1m-$10m | 24\nBetween $10m-$100m | 35\nBetween $100m-$1b | 23\nBetween $1b-$10b | 7\nBetween $10b-$100b | 1\n\n\n* **Aftershocks:** Expect a lot of aftershocks over the next 72 hours. These will taper off, but naturally will be larger due to the significant magnitude of this main event. The largest aftershock can be expected around a 6.7-6.5 event. \n\n* **Tsunami:** NO TSUNAMI WARNING.

The answer is [12-13%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#Race_and_ethnicity). Yes, a group less than 13% of the population continues to pose many dilemmas for a nation of 320 million, 150 years after the end of slavery and 50 years after the end of legal oppression.\n\n*The* great social question in the US for the past two centuries has been\u2014as the Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal wrote in his 1944 book *[An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_Dilemma)*\u2014how to to treat its black residents: First whether to free them from slavery, then whether to fight a war to end slavery, then whether to mandate equal rights for them, then how to deal with the group's persistent social dysfunctions (massively higher per-capita crime and poverty rates, massively lower educational and professional attainments). **Every other** ethnic group has integrated more successfully than black Americans. In almost every area of American society, it is not \"black versus white\", but \"blacks versus everyone else\".\n\nAnd remember, black Americans\u2014unlike most of today's European refugees, or the Islamic residents of Tower Hamlet or Luton or Malmo or French *banlieus*\u2014share the same language, religion, and most aspects of culture with their countrymen.

As an American I want my government to do a much better job of combating illegal immigration, but that's mostly out of concern over the risk to civic society from systematic flouting of laws and borders, and of taking too many people too fast without controls, not because I think that Hispanics or other people are inherently incapable of assimilation. Hispanic immigrants' cultures are similar to that of Americans: Christians that have a reputation of working hard, making good food, and producing fully American children and grandchildren that speak English, serve in the armed forces, and build small businesses.\n\nThere is a well-known phenomenon in many American cities of groups of men, usually of Latin American background, gathering on certain street corners and the parking lots of home-improvement stores.

Nonetheless, there is always demand for their services as they have a reputation for hard work; for Europeans, think of the way the \"Polish plumber\" is seen in your country.\n\nThe usual career track of a young male Mexican illegal immigrant goes something like this:\n\n* Arrives in the US.\n* Travels to a big city.\n* Waits at an aforementioned street corner for work, or works in construction/plumbing for an employer that does not strictly enforce employment restrictions.\n* Gets his own set of tools.\n* Gets his own pickup truck.\n* Meets a nice girl.\n* Obtains legal working papers.\n* Goes into business for himself.\n* Moves to the suburbs with the wife and (fluent in English, not so fluent with Spanish) children.\n\nEuropeans, does anything like that happen in your country?

Here's my response to something a while back in the Seattle subreddit:\n\nProperly formatted permalink: [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/4bfeys/hillary_event_tomorrow_at_rainier_beach_high/d192yuy)\n\nNote: this is not a pro-Hillary comment, this is a comment to clear the air about these talks from someone who works in corporate events.  \n\n\nSo, regarding these kinds of speeches: I work in live corporate events. I've been doing in for 13 years. I travel all over the country doing it, do it at very high level, and have seen many very well known celebrities and politicians (as well as lesser known celebrities and politicians) speak. I've seen Hillary speak before.  \n\n\nWhen it's a mid level celebrity, they're typically soliciting the conference to talk, charging in the $10-50k range, and tailor their talks to the company they're presenting to so that it provides some value.  \n\n\nWhen you have a very high level presenter, like a former president or a major CEO, they're actively courted by the company holding the conference, they charge insane amounts of money (or do it for free for an organization they believe in or for publicity.) But what's more, they talk about whatever the hell they feel like. For example, Neil DeGrass Tyson has spoken at the Tableau conference two years in a row, and he just talks about cool science shit for a while. I saw George W Bush speak at a meeting for a prominent financial company once, and the only thing he said about money was \"I don't think you want my financial advice.\"  \n\n\nWhen I saw Hillary speak, she just talked about her time in the Senate, various issues in the world, and what she thought was happening in the U.S. She did not say anything tailored to the company that paid her to be there.  \n\n\nShe was not yet running for president officially (pre-Obama), and he was not on teleprompter. To get the transcripts from those events, people from her campaign would have to contact the company, have them pull up the archival footage (if they kept it, a lot of times they'll only store it for a year or two,) and then get it transcribed. That can take a long time, or the company might not be willing to release the transcripts themselves because they don't want to be associated with the political fallout.  \n\n\nI can guarantee that she has said something in years of giving talks that would be able to be used against her, because if anyone gives enough talks over a number of years you can misrepresent them--that's what happens to every political candidate ever. So if it's even possible to get the transcripts, I can understand why she wouldn't want to release them.\nAnyway, bottom line is this: Goldman Sachs only pays Hillary $250,000 per speech because she wouldn't be willing to take the gig otherwise (and it's pocket change to them,) and they just want a big name speaker for their event. They'll pay $250,000 to anyone who makes their boring financial conference interesting, and I hope companies keep doing it because otherwise my job is going to suck.  \n\n\nThe reason that Bernie Sanders hasn't done these kind of paid speaking gigs is because until he ran for president, he wasn't a big enough name to draw that kind of money. If he doesn't win the election, you better believe he'll be getting phone calls to do talks for big money. Maybe he'll take it, maybe he won't. But he'll be invited.", "First I want to say, thank you for taking the time to do this ama and answering our questions.\n\nAs a person who has always been deeply interested in hacking and information security, but has no experience in the matter, how would you suggest I get started down this path?

A single elite team like Real Madrid or Barcelona could literally buy out all AFL teams, pay out all contracts, fire all AFL players, and shut down the AFL forever.\n\nThis is now a bantz thread.", "Edit: Youtube link: https://youtu.be/a9FVrJS4MzU\n\nIsfahan is an incredible city rich with art, history, architecture and beauty. The fact that it\u2019s not a commonly traveled tourist destination is logical to me. However, it really saddens me that many people will never see what this city has to offer. To make matters worse, there aren\u2019t enough unique videos or pictures coming out to at least give a glimpse into this ancient modernized city. \n\nMy trip was roughly 3 weeks long. In between seeing family and friends I tried to squeeze in time to take as many photos as I possibly could to hopefully create something that most of you have never seen. There were some of the places I had to get special access to which took a bit of time. Some of the spots were off limits so a bit of bribing came into play. I wanted to make something that would even give the people of Esfahan a different look into their own city. Given I\u2019m not a professional and the time I had to play with, it\u2019s nowhere near perfect. There are countless places I did not get a chance to capture and made a lot of errors along the way. \n\nRegardless, I\u2019m still very proud with the end result and hope to have inspired some of you to travel there some day. Everything you are about to see is either a hyperlapse or a timelapse meaning they\u2019re all pictures turned into film!\n\nHere are some of the project stats:\n\n1 DSLR [ Nikon D5200 ]\n\n2 lenses [ 18-55 mm f3.5-5.5g & 35mm f1.8g ]\n\n+5,000 images \n\nRoughly 120 gigabytes of footage\n\n+100 hours of capturing, editing and processing \n\nWent through 8 hours of music to find the right one.\n\nEdit 1:\n\n~~Alright folks I'm off to bed. I'll answer everyone else as soon as I wake up.~~ Thank you so much for watching my video. I truely did not expect this kind of a response. Your comments made all the hard work worth it. I've also taken a lot of photos of Esfahan. You can see them on my Instagram account if you would like to see more: https://www.instagram.com/navidshahram/\n\nThanks again for all the lovely comments.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI'm back at replying.
