The rules for the contest are as follows:\n\n* the question deemed most original *and* discussion inspiring as voted *by the mods* will receive reddit gold and a night with the supermodel of your choice (provided you seek her/him out of your own accord and they agree to your advances)\n\n* 'Sexiest sex you ever sexed' or any other NSFW threads do not qualify. We want originality, not something you can jerk off to. \n\n* threads do not have to be marked as serious to be considered. \n\n* post must be within all the rules of the sub (duh)\n\n* most importantly: this is not forced entry. If you do not wish to wrack your brain thinking of something new, feel free to ask any of the other generic questions that pop up every day. \n\nApart from that, all you have to do is think of a question to post. We will do all the work of saving links and voting on them and whatnot, so you can browse and read the same way you always do. The contest will last for a fortnight from today (this thread will be stickied the whole time), after which we go to our secret hideout on Skull Island and decide which we think is the winner (or winners, if we can't choose). \n\nEDIT: disclaimer that is apparently required - do not post your questions in here.

This is not currently a requirement, but we'd appreciate it if everyone would try their best to do it. If the TIL you are posting is linking to a Wikipedia page, please directly link to the section of the Wikipedia page that is relevant to your TIL submission.\n\nIn most cases this will be 2 - 3 sentences, but up to 4 - 5 should be fine if more context is required. If it's not possible to copy/paste the text, then a screenshot of the relevant part (preferably highlighted) or indicating where in the link provided is the relevant piece of information located is also acceptable. If the source includes audio or video, then please link to the pertinent time stamp and transcribe it.\n\nNote that if a source is *just* a table, graph or other raw data/statistics then you won't be able to quote it (by design) -- find another source (and see below for an explanation).\n \n---\n\nWe'd also like to clarify our first rule about submissions needing to be verifiable with a  reliable source that **completely** supports the claims in the post title. This means that you **cannot interpret data and draw your own conclusions** -- everything must be clearly and *explicitly* stated in your source, in words. \n\nWe encounter a lot of issues when people try to submit technical papers, statistical data or other studies that *may* support a claim, but one that the authors don't explicitly make (and hence subject to extra scrutiny).  You have to make it clear when a source just provides evidence supporting/refuting a hypothesis, but doesn't go as far as explicitly stating it as an accepted fact.\n\nThis means that **merely quoting statistics and implicitly generalizing the results of a study is often not acceptable**. You also need to be diligent about not misleading people with overly simplified, outdated or refuted claims.\n\n---\n\nAs an example, you may come across a paper describing a study where coffee consumption was found to be associated with reduced incidents of cancer.  A misleading and unacceptable conclusion would be^1:\n\n> TIL coffee can cure 58% of cancer patients\n\nOn the other hand, this would possibly be acceptable as the details make it clear that the result is not definitive:\n\n> TIL a 2004 study found that coffee consumption was negatively correlated with incidents of bowel cancer in senior citizens\n\nYou still have to do your research, because if this was later disproven or brought into question then it may  subsequently removed as misleading by omission. A variation that may better address this is:\n\n> TIL a 2004 study found that coffee consumption was negatively correlated with incidents of bowel cancer in senior citizens, *however subsequent research was unable to replicate the results*\n \nOf course at this point your TIL is less of an attention grabber and not particularly noteworthy, but hopefully this highlights some of the issues we face with verifying sensational claims.\n\n^1 unless the authors made the same unconditional claim (which is highly unlikely).\n\n---\n\nWhile we do our best to verify submissions and remain objective, please note that **extraordinary or controversial claims will likely be subject to more scrutiny** and it is up to contributors to make them as airtight as possible (and us to be pedantic). \n\n**TL;DR**: be extremely careful with primary sources, and don't interpret data/statistics yourself --  find a **reliable** source that does that for you and paraphrase.\n\n---\n\n\nAs always, we encourage everyone to report rule violations and send us a message about inaccurate TILs. If you feel something was unfairly removed then please first check the comments and then feel free to ask us (we try our best to tag all removals, but this system is somewhat limited).\n\n", "Provide them in this thread.

Not *too* much actually changed this month, but we had some foundations worked out which will better help us make changes in the future.\n\n---\n\n#Verified Photographer flair!\n\nOur largest change in the month of March, we added a new process and flair for people to become verified on /r/pics - Verification allows photographers and artists to post directly from their site (assuming they follow reddit spam guidelines). With this, we hope to urge photographers to share their work with /r/pics, as well as show our subscribers some of the best! If you are interested in this flair, please read more in the sticky below this one!\n\n#Automod refresh\n\nOur automod config got a bit smarter. Nothing much to say here, but hopefully less false positives and better spam stopping\n\n#New mods - Unlimited power\n\nAfter working with our new moderators, all have been \"promoted\" to a full moderator. Each even got their own banhammer! We didn't need to share this time!\n\n#Continued work on flair\n\nAgain, not too much happened public facing in the month of March, but we did manage to work a bit more on our flair, and there should be more to say about this in the upcoming months.\n\n---\n\nWe expect to have one new rule addition out in the month of April, with more coming soon.\n\n---\n\nNow let's get to the part everyone cares about:\n\n#Stats\n\nIn March 2016 we:\n\n* Made 42680 moderator actions (Up about 3000 from last month)\n\n* Removed a total of 14709 (Up only 300 or so from last month)\n\n* Removed a total of 8276 comments\n\n* Banned a total of 604 people (This includes temporary and permanent bans)\n\n* Manually unbanned 41 people. (This does not include temp bans expiring)\n\n* Ignored 953 of your reports (Compared to the thousands we get, keep reporting!)\n\n* Stickied 25 posts or comments\n\n* Locked 3 posts (and unlocked one)\n\nIn the month of March, reddit administrators made ***ZERO*** actions\n\nIn the month of March, we received a total of 1 post takedown requests.   \n1 was completely unactionable  \n0 were actioned by us  \n0 were forwarded to reddit and no action was taken on our part", "In the past we've discouraged links to unfamiliar image hosts because we tend to crash their servers or bankrupt them with bandwidth fees whenever they hit the front page and get hit with front-page traffic. In a few egregious cases, we've also encountered a bit of excessive self-promotion.\n\nThis had led to shutting-out many professional photographers and artists who would like to submit their work to /r/pics while hosting the images on their own sites, rather than just imgur, 500px, flickr or deviantart.\n\nMost of the hosting issues seem to have been worked out over the last few years: many good hosts now have affordable plans that can take a 5K-karma post without handing you a bill for half your life savings.

Coauthor Dana Nuccitelli also did a background post on his blog at the Guardian [here](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/apr/13/its-settled-90100-of-climate-experts-agree-on-human-caused-global-warming). \n\nYou may have heard the statistic \u201c97% of climate experts agree that humans are causing global warming.\u201d You may also have wondered where that number comes from, or even have heard that it was \u201cdebunked\u201d. This metanalysis looks at a wealth of surveys (of scientists as well as the scientific literature) about scientific agreement on human-caused global warming, and [finds that among climate experts, the ~97% level among climate experts is pretty robust](http://i.imgur.com/oCevIhE.jpg). \n\nThe upshot of our paper is that [the level of agreement with the consensus view increases with expertise](http://i.imgur.com/L7xpRny.png). \n\nWhen people claim the number is lower, they usually do so by cherry-picking the responses of groups of non-experts, such as [petroleum geologists](http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2013/02/14/james-taylor-misinterprets-study-by-180-degrees/) or [weathercasters](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/dec/02/meteorologists-global-warming-consensus). \n\nWhy does any of this matter? Well, there is a growing body of scientific literature that shows the public\u2019s perception of scientific agreement is a \u201cgateway belief\u201d for their attitudes on environmental questions (e.g. [Ding et *al.*, 2011](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n9/full/nclimate1295.html, [Aklin and Urpelainen, 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901113002141), [van der Linden *et al.*, 2015](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118489), and more). In other words, if the public thinks scientists are divided on an issue, that causes the public to be less likely to agree that a problem exists and makes them less willing to do anything about it. Making sure the public understands the high level of expert agreement on this topic allows the public dialog to advance to more interesting and pressing questions, like what as a society we decided to do about the issue. \n\nWe're here to answer your questions about this paper and more general, related topics.

I've always been interested in figuring out how things work and my research blends that interest with biology. I use an evolutionary approach to understand why animals are shaped the way they're shaped, This kind of work is sometimes called functional morphology or comparative biomechanics. \nI specifically focus on the toe pads of gecko lizards, an amazing example of natural nano-technology. Gecko toe pads are a really great system to work with because they have some really unusual mechanics and evolutionary patterns. Unlike other adhesives you may be familiar with (glue, tape, velcro, suction cups), gecko toe pads work completely differently. They are made up of tiny hair-like structures that are much smaller then mammalian hair. These structures are small enough to interact with the surface the gecko is walking on using van der Waals forces (an induced dipole - induced dipole weak intermolecular bond). Simply put, the fact that the gecko hairs are very small and have electrons spinning around them and the surface the gecko is walking on also has electrons spinning around its molecules, results in the gecko hairs being weakly attracted towards the surface. \nThe really interesting part is trying to figure out why there is so much variation across species. Gecko toe pads come in different shapes and their hairs also come in different lengths, diameters, and densities. We're just now beginning to look into how/why this variation evolved and its affect on performance. \nWith this research, we'll not only gain a better understanding of how life on our planet has evolved and adapted to different environments, but some of the things we learn can be applied to help solve complex human problems (biomimicry), like sticking to things in space or designing Spiderman gloves. \n\nI also have a live crowdfunding project at https://experiment.com/projects/are-the-feet-of-gecko-lizards-adapted-to-different-surface-textures you should check out. \n\nI will be back at 1 pm ET to answer your questions, Ask Me Anything!\n\n\nSorry everybody!

Does he listen to you?\n\n2.  The book \"Wikinomics\", written by Don Tapscot and Anthony D. Williams, opens up with the innovative and open source approach taken by Goldcorp a few years back when facing an important challenge in finding a new mine in one of their concessions. Do you think that the open source approach introduced and prominently advocated by the whole idea of Linux an the Linux universe can be applied in some way to the corporate world? That is, do you think that corporate processes, such as the R&amp;D, could be carried out using an open source approach?\n\n3. Do you think society is on the verge of facing another major paradigm shift in the way people approach Internet? As paradigm shift I mean the clash between the social network idea of Internet and the anonymity.  More specifically, in the last 10  to 15 years, social networks have become the prominent reason for which billions of users brows the network every day. My question regards the general perception that the Internet user is becoming more and more sick of having to share it's personal information.\n\n4. It has been few years now that some products of the Linux universe have become available for mobile communication (Ex. Ubuntu touch, 2011). Do you think Linux based OS for smartphones will be able to overcome the legal and technical bind between machine and software, thus making it as easy to install as it is for PCs? In short, will smartphones be able to go full open source?  \n\n5. Lately there has been an incremental discussion on the development of AI and the ChatBot. Both Facebook and Google have made important acquisitions in startups of this field. Do you think Linux will also be able to play an important role in such field? Furthermore, do you think that if some or all IA start ups would had shared their insights and undertake a more open source approach the field would have already come up with more prominent achievements?\n\n6. What is your take on AI? Professor Jeffrey D. Sachs of Columbia, in recent debate at the NY Graduate Center with Nobel Laureate Paul R. Krugman, said that IA would help lower the cost of foreign aid and thereby give a strong hand in the reduction and eventually the end of world poverty. Do you agree on his view and do you think that the .com industry is going towards that direction?\n\n7. Last question on the topic AI. Do you think that there is the possibility of a second .com bubble? Looking at the race to IA and the increasing number of start ups and other companies investing in this field I can't help but thinking of what happened in the late 90s. Do you think people in the field are diving too quickly head over heels in it?\n \nPublic Contact Information.\nTwitter account: @jzemlin | Blog: http://www.linuxfoundation.org/blogs/jzemlin", "Graduated from the Vet Tech Institute in 2008 2nd in my class. I've since worked in both specialty practices as well as privately and corporately owned small animal clinics. I'm currently at a small animal clinic that does occasionally see \"pocket pets\".\n\nIn addition to my full time job as a vet tech, I also pet sit full time in clients' houses. Some of my clients live in multi-million dollar houses and have very famous next door neighbors. I've done everything from feeding hamsters to transporting cats 6 hours one-way to their new owners for clients (never again will I do that...).\n\nI also volunteer weekly at a local wildlife rehab center ([just transported a sick fox kit to them yesterday](http://imgur.com/ZWuYiMQ), SO cute) and once monthly at a feral cat TNR (trap and release) clinic where we trap, vaccinate, deworm, spay/neuter feral kitties and then release them back into their colonies. I also hold a seat on my state's Vet Tech Association board.\n\nWith all of my free time that I manage to have, I'm also planning a wedding and do agility with my 2.5 year old Aussie/BC gal, Nova. My furry crew also includes an 11 year old red merle aussie, [Jamie](http://imgur.com/DyddBCe); a brown DSH tabby [Voltron](http://imgur.com/Rq5twQu); two tabby point siamese mixes, [Jorah](http://imgur.com/NzztfDq) and [Espeon](http://imgur.com/Rq5twQu); two Sugar Gliders, Banjo and Kazooie; and two Florida box turtles, Pixel and Byte.\n\n[Jorah has an especially interesting story](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/3tnpj0/hes_home_update_on_the_baby_kitty_fighting_for/), as he was a feral kitty brought into the TNR clinic on the verge of death so I took him home to care for him. Ended up needing 24 hour hospitalization where he went into cardiopulmonary arrest, but they were able to quickly bring him back to life. He is my miracle baby and is doing fantastic now!!\n\nAMA!\n\n**PROOF:** I don't have a copy of my current license, as it is on display at the clinic atm, [but here is my pocket license from last year](http://imgur.com/LDPMYhM).\n\nAnd [here is me walking a client's cat](http://imgur.com/a/62bth), in case you needed extra reassurance that I am, indeed, crazy enough to do all of these things.\n\n**EDIT** I'll be checking in periodically throughout the afternoon, as I'm at a client's house and their backyard is just to die for.", "Hello!

Since fireflies are culturally important, scientifically important, and have declining populations from problems like habitat destruction, light pollution, and overuse of pesticides, our team proposed the sequencing of the firefly genome in order to preserve the valuable scientific knowledge still locked in the genome and provide genetic markers to help conserve fireflies for the next generation.\n\nWe have these members of team firefly answering your questions today:\n\n* Seth Bybee - Assistant professor of Biology at BYU\n* Sarah Sander - Postdoctoral associate at Cornell\n* Tim Fallon - PhD student at MIT\n\nProof below!\n\n* Proof #1: https://twitter.com/fireflygenome/status/721379714045227008\n* Proof #2: https://www.facebook.com/fireflygenome/\n\nDid we mention that the firefly genome is currently a top 5 finalist in a public contest for a fully-funded high-quality genome sequencing?
